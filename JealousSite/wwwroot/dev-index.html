<p>Sean from The Chairman’s Bao was wondering a while back: <a href="http://www.thechairmansbao.com/has-it-become-too-easy-for-people-to-learn-mandarin-chinese/" target="_blank">Has it become too easy for people to learn Mandarin Chinese?</a> Read that post, it’s great writing! In fact, read just about everything on their site. Then come back to learn why I say the answer is a resounding <i>No</i>.</p>

<p>Call my lights dim, but I’d actually been using Pleco for years before the meaning of all those colors in each headword started to dawn on me. They stand for tones! From that baseline it was a long way until tone colors made it into <a href="http://handedict.zydeo.net/" target="_blank">HanDeDict@Zydeo</a>, and I thought that’s a good excuse for a short post on here.</p>

<p>I’m just about ready to tag the Github repository with <em>release-1-0</em>, build an installer and finally, officially, <em>really</em> usher Zydeo 1.0 out the door. But while I’m waiting for the digital certificate (the very first I’ve ever owned) that I need to sign the installer, I’ve decided to do some last-minute dusting and testing. Caution: there be dragons in Windows XP’s cupboard.<br />TL;DR: Zydeo will run on Windows XP, and look nearly as good as on later versions.</p>

<p>This is a follow-up to a previous <a href="http://blog.zydeo.net/pc-speak-chinese/" title="PC speak Chinese">collection of online resources</a> that you need if you are to create Chinese language processing software – e.g., a new dictionary :) The previous post was about fonts, dictionaries and example sentences; read on for more esoteric stuff such as character recognition, frequency lists and stroke order animations here.</p>

<p>I’ve explored and collected a wealth of links to online resources as I was working on Zydeo. I hope you’ll find some of these pointers useful; I get the personal benefit of keeping them organized here for my own future reference.</p>

<p>Most of what we do in life is about doing stuff with a bunch of stuff at hand. Programming and UI design are no exceptions. It is all too easy to overlook the impact the number of things in “stuff” has on the outcome. This post is about edge cases.</p>

<p>In my search for the right regular script (Kai) display font for Chinese characters in Zydeo, I discovered two free fonts and became quite intimately familiar with both of them. Much of the story behind them is shrouded in mystery (and that’s not very likely to change), but even the little details tell a fascinating story.</p>

<p>I hate emoji. You know, those colorful icons: smiley faces, sad faces, thumbs up and their countless friends that we use all the time in short text messages and email. It’s not that I’m a purist that thinks emoji spell the end of literacy, particularly among those horrible teenagers. No, quite the contrary: I know full well that language and culture have been in constant decline since at least the time of the ancient Greek; I don’t buy into this kind of stuff. I actually like icons in text.</p>

<p>Anyone who’s dealing with Chinese knows all about simplified and traditional characters, right? I sure thought I did, but even as I was working on Zydeo, very self-assured of my knowledge, I discovered a whole bunch of subtle and unanticipated details. So I thought it’s worth dedicating a post to this topic, going back to first principles.</p>

<p>While thinking about the best way to visually present dictionary entries in Zydeo I had to dig into Chinese typography, so I thought I’d do a couple of posts to share what I’ve learned in the process. I hope you’ll find some of this information useful.</p>
