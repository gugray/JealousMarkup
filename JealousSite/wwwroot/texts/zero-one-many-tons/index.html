<h1>Zero, one, many, tons</h1>
<p class="lede">Most of what we do in life is about doing stuff with a bunch of stuff at hand. Programming and UI design are no exceptions. It is all too easy to overlook the impact the number of things in “stuff” has on the outcome. This post is about edge cases.</p>

<h2>Traps</h2>
<p>
  The most trivial mistake you can make is to forget about edge cases
  altogether. I improvised a piece of truly messed up code to show this.
  The function below receives an array of integers, and it’s supposed to
  return an index showing where the value in the first slot occurs later
  on in the array, or -1 if it doesn’t occur again.
</p>
<div style="font-size: 70%;">
  <div><div id="highlighter_482852" class="syntaxhighlighter  csharp"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><div class="line number1 index0 alt2">1</div><div class="line number2 index1 alt1">2</div><div class="line number3 index2 alt2">3</div><div class="line number4 index3 alt1">4</div><div class="line number5 index4 alt2">5</div><div class="line number6 index5 alt1">6</div><div class="line number7 index6 alt2">7</div><div class="line number8 index7 alt1">8</div><div class="line number9 index8 alt2">9</div></td><td class="code"><div class="container"><div class="line number1 index0 alt2"><code class="csharp keyword">int</code> <code class="csharp plain">IndexOfFirstInRest(</code><code class="csharp keyword">int</code><code class="csharp plain">[] array)</code></div><div class="line number2 index1 alt1"><code class="csharp plain">{</code></div><div class="line number3 index2 alt2"><code class="csharp spaces">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code class="csharp keyword">int</code> <code class="csharp plain">first = array[0];</code></div><div class="line number4 index3 alt1"><code class="csharp spaces">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code class="csharp keyword">for</code> <code class="csharp plain">(</code><code class="csharp keyword">int</code> <code class="csharp plain">i = 1; i != array.Length; ++i)</code></div><div class="line number5 index4 alt2"><code class="csharp spaces">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code class="csharp plain">{</code></div><div class="line number6 index5 alt1"><code class="csharp spaces">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code class="csharp keyword">if</code> <code class="csharp plain">(array[i] == first) </code><code class="csharp keyword">return</code> <code class="csharp plain">i;</code></div><div class="line number7 index6 alt2"><code class="csharp spaces">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code class="csharp plain">}</code></div><div class="line number8 index7 alt1"><code class="csharp spaces">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code class="csharp keyword">return</code> <code class="csharp plain">-1;</code></div><div class="line number9 index8 alt2"><code class="csharp plain">}</code></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>
</div>
<p>As long as you only ever pass arrays that have at least two elements this code works fine, but it breaks in two obvious cases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    An array with only a single element: the <em>for</em> cycle will
    never terminate. Depending on your language, you may get a runtime error
    the first time the code attempts to index into the array beyond its
    length, or it may just produce “undefined behavior,” fetching values
    from memory it has no business reading, and repeating as many times as
    there are integers in the language.
  </li>
  <li>
    An array with zero elements: even worse than before, the code is
    invalid from the very first statement, producing either a runtime error
    or undefined behavior.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  You could say this is such a blatantly flawed piece of code no
  developer would ever commit it to a real code base. In reality, failure
  to account for trivial edge cases like this make up a huge share of bugs
  I have fixed over my carreer – and also a huge share of the bugs I
  created myself.
</p>
<p>
  It’s fair to say this function is never meant to receive arrays that
  are shorter than 2 elements (not to mention null pointers/references
  instead of an actual array, a case I didn’t even bring up). That’s the
  function’s contract. Some languages provide explicit ways to declare
  such contracts; others give you the means to manually check for edge
  cases and barf if the function is called in ways it is not meant to be.
  Then there is the school that says whoever calls the function should
  know what they are doing and have the discipline to honor the contract;
  in exchange, they receive a faster function without built-in sanity
  checks.
</p>
<p>
  When I structure my own code, a lot of the effort goes into making
  sure it’s not even possible to use my artifacts in ways that don’t make
  sense. Most likely you don’t want to do this kind of duplicate searching
  on any old array – probably the array itself is part of a larger entity
  that can never contain less than two integers here. That’s the entity’s
  <em>invariant</em>, and if you represent it as a class, you can make
  sure there’s no way to end up with an instance that has fewer than two
  values. Inside that class, the function above would be perfectly legit.
</p>
<p>
  Yet in reality code evolves; you, or a different developer, may
  change their mind about that class’s invariant years into the future,
  and forget about the poor function that relied on it. In ways that are
  sometimes subtle, sometimes hideous, edge cases return to bite us, even
  if we spend a lot of our time thinking about them.
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <strong>Note:</strong> You could say I was using the wrong
    example here – what I showed was an ignored constraint; edge cases are
    about extreme values that are legal within the constraints. Does the
    routine above work well with the minimum “legal” number of items? Does
    it work OK with one more? What if legal includes zero, one and many? You
    are right; I lead you astray. But read on.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  Now let me take a closer look at some contrasts, and how they affect
  not only programming (doing stuff with stuff) but also UI design
  (showing stuff).
</p>
<h2>One/many</h2>
<p>How is dealing with a single piece of something different from dealing with many? Here’s one dictionary entry from Zydeo:</p>
<p><a class="more-link" href="http://blog.zydeo.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/zmtns-01-oneentry.png"><img src="06-zero-one-many-tons_files/zmtns-01-oneentry.png" alt="." class="alignnone size-full wp-image-140" width="963" height="127"></a></p>
<p>Does the same layout work when you have at least two entries to list?</p>
<p><a class="more-link" href="http://blog.zydeo.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/zmtns-02-twoentries.png"><img src="06-zero-one-many-tons_files/zmtns-02-twoentries.png" alt="." class="alignnone size-full wp-image-141" width="964" height="216"></a></p>
<p>
  It turns out it works (because I already put a lot of effort into
  making sure it does), but there are new things to keep in mind. The
  typography of the headword’s Hanzi and Pinyin go a long way towards
  visually structuring what you see and making sure you can identify
  what’s a single entry and where each new entry starts. But I felt more
  was needed to separate items, hence the dotted line.
</p>
<p>
  That dotted line is the odd thing: you don’t want to show it if
  there’s only a single entry on screen, and you don’t want it at the very
  end of a list either; that would just build a pointless visual cage
  into your canvas. “One” in this respect is different from “many,” and
  the “last” is different from all the rest.
</p>
<p>
  Lists, if you come to think of it, are all over the place. What
  movies are playing tonight? What books by Pynchon can I buy online? What
  charges did I put on my card last month? We have come a long way
  (mostly) from lists like these:
</p>
<p><a class="more-link" href="http://blog.zydeo.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/zmtns-03-badlist.png"><img src="06-zero-one-many-tons_files/zmtns-03-badlist.png" alt="." class="alignnone size-full wp-image-142" width="291" height="278"></a></p>
<p>Compare that with this generally familiar list:</p>
<p><a class="more-link" href="http://blog.zydeo.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/zmtns-04-goodlist.png"><img src="06-zero-one-many-tons_files/zmtns-04-goodlist.png" alt="." class="alignnone size-full wp-image-143" width="800" height="505"></a></p>
<h2>Many/tons (design)</h2>
<p>
  This is the divide where it starts to get exciting. OK, you came up
  with the mother of all lists, and it works great if you have a handful
  or a few dozen items. Does it work well when you have thousands? Tens of
  thousands? The reason I find this particularly exciting because this is
  where design and programming become inseparable.
</p>
<p>
  But first, a purely design aspect. If you have so much of something
  that it doesn’t fit on a screen, you must make choices. Add a scrollbar?
  Add paging? Cut the list after X items? Only load X items first, then
  expand the list if the user scrolls to the bottom, and/or explicitly
  clicks to request more?
</p>
<p>
  Let’s say you opted purely for scrolling. That immediately creates an
  additional zero/one contrast: do you want to always show the scrollbar,
  even when it’s not needed? Or make it appear only when the content no
  longer fits on the screen? Having gotten that out of the way: is your
  scrollbar still usable when the list is really, really long?
</p>
<p>Here’s a scrollbar (horizontal just to make it fit better with the text here):</p>
<p><a class="more-link" href="http://blog.zydeo.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/zmtns-05-scrolla.png"><img src="06-zero-one-many-tons_files/zmtns-05-scrolla.png" alt="." class="alignnone size-full wp-image-144" width="529" height="30"></a></p>
<p>
  The darker grey rectangle is the “thumb,” the part that you can drag
  to move your “window” over the really big canvas you’re looking at. The
  thumb’s size gives you an idea of the size of that canvas: if the canvas
  is big and your screen is small, then the “window” is relatively small,
  so the thumb is smaller too:
</p>
<p><a class="more-link" href="http://blog.zydeo.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/zmtns-06-scrollb.png"><img src="06-zero-one-many-tons_files/zmtns-06-scrollb.png" alt="." class="alignnone size-full wp-image-145" width="529" height="30"></a></p>
<p>
  But what happens when the canvas becomes really, really huge? So huge
  that the thumb, if you want to be proportional, is reduced to a single
  pixel? This is a really nasty thing to do to your users:
</p>
<p><a class="more-link" href="http://blog.zydeo.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/zmtns-07-scrollc.png"><img src="06-zero-one-many-tons_files/zmtns-07-scrollc.png" alt="." class="alignnone size-full wp-image-146" width="528" height="31"></a></p>
<p>Anticipating these edge cases and handling them elegantly is what sets fine interfaces apart from mediocre ones.</p>
<h2>Many/tons (programming)</h2>
<p>
  Suppose you figured out the behavior of your scrollbar when really
  large canvases are at play. But is your tool really able to copy with,
  say, displaying 25 thousand entries when someone puts “to,” the most
  frequent English word in CEDICT, in the search field and hits Enter? Or
  does that blow up the tool?
</p>
<p>
  Granted, that is not a realistic use case; I cannot think of a
  real-life situation where I would want to browse 25 thousand dictionary
  entries for whatever purpose. But this fits into a broader set of design
  decisions.
</p>
<p>
  If you think showing 25k entries is not realistic, but still it can
  easily happen given the specific data you work with, does that mean you
  should actively limit the number of results? If yes, then where exactly –
  at 100 entries? Or 531? You can arbitrarily cut the list, or choose to
  show only entries that contain the search text and nothing else, or
  complicate the search with a system of asterisks to define where you
  want partial matching, or add paging, or…
</p>
<p>
  I thought through these dilemmas for Zydeo and consciously decided
  that in order to keep searching simple, I’ll avoid all the tedious
  wildcards, paging and the like. This means you are free to put in “to”
  and Zydeo should not explode on Enter. While this is not how I expect
  Zydeo to be used, making it fast enough to deal with 25k entries has the
  benefit that it will be really, eye-blinkingly fast in the typical
  scenarios.
</p>
<p>
  This was a relatively easy decision to make because all the factors
  are under my control. If Zydeo were a browser-based online dictionary,
  downloading thousands of entries may take too long, and browsers may
  have a problem displaying such amounts of formatted text, no matter how
  much I optimize my own code. That would be a different scenario with
  different constraints, and I would probably make different decisions
  right down to the way how lookup works. For what it’s worth, desktop
  tools still have a tremendous performance edge over browser-based,
  online software.
</p>
<p>
  At the end of the day, these decisions are the consequences of your
  priorities and the technological constraints you must work with.
  Designing any piece of software is a process of negotiating these
  factors and your users’ priorities to find that sweet spot where the
  cost of creating the tool is in balance with the value it adds to users’
  lives. Making it your second nature to identify edge cases and argue
  about them improves your chances of finding that sweet spot.
</p>
<h2>Zero/any</h2>
<p>
  Remember the silly function from the start of the post? Passing a
  zero-length array (or even null) is a classic zero/any contrast in
  programming. Developers are, generally speaking, used to these. What
  seems to have a much shorter tradition is thinking about zero
  information in UI design.
</p>
<p>
  Zero information comes in two frequent forms. The first is when no
  one has asked a question yet, so there is nothing to say. The second is
  when a question has been asked, but there is no answer to show.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>No question yet.</strong> It might seem the only thing a poor
  computer program can do if you haven’t asked it a question yet is show a
  blank screen, right? It turns out we can do much better than that. For
  many kinds of apps or tools, if you know the current time, the person’s
  location, and the questions he or she has asked in the past, you can
  already make a very informed guess at what the next question might be,
  and anticipate it by showing that information. If someone opens a public
  transport timetable app on a weekday morning, and she typically checks
  commutes to the same destination (her job) at that time of day, then you
  might just start by showing the options to get to her work from her
  location right now.
</p>
<p>
  If that kind of thinking doesn’t make sense for your tool, you can still use the opening screen’s whitespace to show <em>Getting started</em>
  tips for new users. A word processor might make it easier to start
  writing if it shows a title box and the place for the first sentence,
  perhaps with a grey cue.
</p>
<p>
  Zydeo, for now, opens with an empty starting screen. What I think may make sense in a dictionary is a short <em>Getting started</em>
  page for new users, but I can see how that would become irritating if
  you used the tool every day. Sure, when there is something new (like an
  update), the empty screen at startup is the best place to show a
  notification. But for the rest, I haven’t made up my mind yet.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>No answer.</strong> If there’s no dictionary entry for the
  word the user just put in, is showing an empty screen really your best
  shot? For now, that’s actually what happens in Zydeo, apart from a text
  saying “No results” in the area where Zydeo normally shows the number of
  results after a successful query.
</p>
<p>
  Showing <em>absolutely nothing</em> if a query yields no results is a
  really bad idea. It is disconcerting; how am I to tell if I just asked
  the wrong question, or if the software is malfunctioning? And in either
  case: what am I supposed to do next?
</p>
<p>
  This is definitely one area where Zydeo can (and will, soon) do much
  better. When there’s no entry for a Chinese query, Zydeo could at least
  break it down into its parts and show shorter words; effectively
  answering a different but similar question.
