<h1>Chinese typefaces: simplified and traditional</h1>
<p class="lede">Anyone who’s dealing with Chinese knows all about simplified and traditional characters, right? I sure thought I did, but even as I was working on Zydeo, very self-assured of my knowledge, I discovered a whole bunch of subtle and unanticipated details. So I thought it’s worth dedicating a post to this topic, going back to first principles.</p>

<h2>Hanzi, Kanji and Hanja</h2>
<p>
  Characters originating from the historical Chinese writing system are
  currently used in a number of countries, as part of several different
  scripts. They are used to write Mandarin Chinese in the PRC (Mainland
  China), Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore. A very similar, but not
  identical, set of characters is used to write Cantonese, particularly in
  Hong Kong and by overseas Chinese communities. (This is a true
  statement regardless of the very complicated and loaded question of
  whether Cantonese is a separate language or a dialect; a topic I
  definitely don’t want to pick up here.) The Mandarin Chinese term for
  these characters is <span style="font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, sans-serif;">汉字•漢字 [hànzì]</span>; from here on, I’ll refer to them as Hanzi.
</p>
<p>
  Over the course of history, various East Asian cultures borrowed
  Chinese characters to write different languages. Thus, to this day,
  these characters, called Kanji, are a central part of the Japanese
  writing system. To an increasingly diminishing extent, they are also
  still used in South Korea, where they are referred to as Hanja.
</p>
<p>
  As these things go, writing systems change over time. For many Hanzi,
  a straight line of “written etymology” can be reconstructed that traces
  their development from symbols on oracle bones all the way to modern
  forms that you see in print or on computer screens.
</p>
<p>
  At different stages, there were centralized, conscious efforts of
  simplifying characters for practical purposes. This definitely happened
  to some extent in Japan, but I am not familiar with the circumstances of
  Japanese Kanji simplification. In the PRC, a huge effort of
  simplification was undertaken in the 1950s, with the explicit goal of
  spreading literacy by reducing the number of strokes needed to write
  commonly used characters.
</p>
<p>
  Since the communities using the descendants of a writing system from
  an earlier era were acting independently, we ended up with more or less
  minor variations in how the same character is written – meaning,
  typically, different stroke order, or slightly shorter or longer strokes
  in particular places, a tilted stroke instead of a horizontal one etc.
</p>
<h2>The differences</h2>
<p>
  As far as Japanese vs Chinese simplification goes, we have situations
  where the same traditional character was simplified in different ways:
</p>

      <td>Simplified Kanji (Japan)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>
  In the 1950s PRC simplification effort, the result was sometimes an
  altogether new character that was previously not in use; one such case
  is shown below:
</p>
<p><a class="more-link" href="http://blog.zydeo.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ctfst-04-simp-newform.png"><img src="03-chinese-typefaces-simplified-and-traditional_files/ctfst-04-simp-newform.png" alt="." class="alignnone size-full wp-image-79" width="292" height="106"></a></p>
<p>
  In other cases, one or more traditional characters were “conflated”
  onto a single pre-existing character. Such a case is shown below;
  incidentally, this particular conflation has given rise, in the age of
  machine translation, to <a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=6581" target="_blank">countless profane and deeply amusing mistranslations</a>.
</p>
<p><a class="more-link" href="http://blog.zydeo.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ctfst-05-simp-conflate.png"><img src="03-chinese-typefaces-simplified-and-traditional_files/ctfst-05-simp-conflate.png" alt="." class="alignnone size-full wp-image-80" width="798" height="110"></a></p>
<p>
  Simplification did not only affect full characters, but also
  frequently recurring components – particularly certain radicals. Compare
  the traditional and simplified characters below, which both contain the
  “speech” radical, in its traditional and simplified form, respectively.
</p>
<p><a class="more-link" href="http://blog.zydeo.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ctfst-06-simp-radical.png"><img src="03-chinese-typefaces-simplified-and-traditional_files/ctfst-06-simp-radical.png" alt="." class="alignnone size-full wp-image-81" width="301" height="99"></a></p>
<p>
  Finally, a big group of characters were not simplified either in the
  PRC or Japan, but through the gradual shift of conventions, they ended
  up being written slightly differently. Such a case is shown below, with
  the character in a traditional typeface on the left, and a simplified
  typeface on the right.
</p>
<p><a class="more-link" href="http://blog.zydeo.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ctfst-07-simptrad-same-but-different.png"><img src="03-chinese-typefaces-simplified-and-traditional_files/ctfst-07-simptrad-same-but-different.png" alt="." class="alignnone size-full wp-image-82" width="221" height="92"></a></p>
<h2>The similarities</h2>
<p>
  Along came, from the 1990s onwards, the global standard Unicode,
  whose aim is to assign a “code point,” a commonly agreed and
  standardized number, to every written symbol occurring in every script
  used anywhere on the planet. Before we had Unicode, the standards
  organizations of different countries, or very often, plain old software
  companies, came up with arbitrary code points for whatever set of
  characters they needed to encode.
</p>
<p>
  The experts working on standardizing Hanzi, Kanji and Hanja sifted
  through existing standards of different countries and a huge number of
  characters to decide what should be treated as a different character,
  and what should be considered as the same character, just written
  slightly differently due to convention. This process is called Han
  unification, and while it’s still occasionally contested and criticized,
  it was doubtless necessary for a very simple reason: there are a huge
  number of Hanzi/Kanji/Hanja around.
</p>
<p>
  After all, no sane person would consider the two symbols below from
  the Latin alphabet as different characters; so why should we consider
  the two Hanzi right below them as different?
</p>
<p>
  <a class="more-link" href="http://blog.zydeo.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ctfst-08-latin-styles.png"><img src="03-chinese-typefaces-simplified-and-traditional_files/ctfst-08-latin-styles.png" alt="." class="alignnone size-full wp-image-83" width="206" height="79"></a><br>
  <a class="more-link" href="http://blog.zydeo.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ctfst-07-simptrad-same-but-different.png"><img src="03-chinese-typefaces-simplified-and-traditional_files/ctfst-07-simptrad-same-but-different.png" alt="." class="alignnone size-full wp-image-82" width="221" height="92"></a>
</p>
<p>
  But because of the highly ambiguous way in which characters were
  simplified at different times and in different places, simplified and
  traditional variants of the same character had to be assigned to
  different code points – effectively making them different characters in
  Unicode.
</p>
<h2>The ambiguity</h2>
<p>
  Remember the example where three traditional characters are “folded”
  into a single character, which, however, is a pre-existing character and
  itself already serves as a “traditional” symbol?
</p>
<p><a class="more-link" href="http://blog.zydeo.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ctfst-05-simp-conflate.png"><img src="03-chinese-typefaces-simplified-and-traditional_files/ctfst-05-simp-conflate.png" alt="." class="alignnone size-full wp-image-80" width="798" height="110"></a></p>
<p>
  This ambiguity of the 1950s Han simplification means that there is no
  way to automatically convert a text written in simplified characters to
  traditional ones: you need to make sense of the text to decide if you
  need to substitute a specific character, and if yes, with which
  traditional one. Going from traditional to simplified is slightly less
  ambiguous, but in many cases even that is not obvious.
</p>
<p>
  What I find particularly intriguing is the way <a href="http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:%E9%A6%96%E9%A1%B5" target="_blank">Chinese Wikipedia</a>
  works. It treats Chinese as a single language, and offers a drop-down
  menu at the top with automatic conversion options. Individual articles
  are apparently authored in a random mix of simplified and traditional,
  and even the script of the headwords is unpredictable.
</p>
<p><a class="more-link" href="http://blog.zydeo.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ctfst-10-wikipedia.png"><img src="03-chinese-typefaces-simplified-and-traditional_files/ctfst-10-wikipedia.png" alt="." class="alignnone size-full wp-image-84" width="241" height="290"></a></p>
<p>
  I found no description of how this automatic conversion used by
  Wikipedia works, and I have no way to judge the results. If you have any
  pointers here, do let me know!
</p>
<h2>What this all has to do with typefaces</h2>
<p>Let’s take a look at the expanded version of a table with Chinese fonts I already included in a <a href="http://blog.zydeo.net/chinese-typefaces/" title="Chinese typefaces">previous post</a>, now with simplified and traditional sample text side by side:</p>
<p><a class="more-link" href="http://blog.zydeo.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ctfst-11-winfonts-simptrad.png"><img src="03-chinese-typefaces-simplified-and-traditional_files/ctfst-11-winfonts-simptrad.png" alt="." class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85" width="789" height="743"></a></p>
<p>
  While I was still young and naïve, I assumed all I needed to show
  Chinese text, whether simplified or traditional, is a font that contains
  a graph for all the characters I needed – i.e., a  glyph for all the
  simplified and traditional characters that occur in my text. Most of the
  fonts in this list have a very broad coverage (with the notable
  exception of the very first one, but more on that in a different post).
  So that’s all done and taken care of, right?
</p>
<p>
  Wrong. Because Han unification in Unicode means that a character like <span style="font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, sans-serif;">英</span> or <span style="font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, sans-serif;">雪</span>
  only has a single code point, you need to choose a different font if
  you’re displaying it to an audience that’s used to simplified characters
  vs. traditional ones. Observe the subtle differences in both characters
  below, particularly the split grass radical at the top of traditional <span style="font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, sans-serif;">英</span>. The characters are presented here with Google’s Noto font, a Heiti (Gothic) typeface.
</p>
<p><a class="more-link" href="http://blog.zydeo.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ctfst-12-noto-simptrad.png"><img src="03-chinese-typefaces-simplified-and-traditional_files/ctfst-12-noto-simptrad.png" alt="." class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86" width="397" height="206"></a></p>
<p>
  These differences may seem minor, but in the experience I gathered in my day job designing <a href="https://www.memoq.com/" target="_blank">memoQ</a>,
  an application with a central text editing component, they are mutually
  unacceptable to audiences accustomed to one or the other type of
  Chinese script. In Zydeo, I decided this was an essential detail: for a
  non-native learner or user of Chinese, showing characters that are
  “wrong” in some subtle way is either confusing or disorienting, and it
  should really not happen.
</p>
<h2>The last word on Song vs Ming</h2>
<p>
  There is a great article by Richard Ishida, a member of the Word Wide
  Web Consortium, about simplified and traditional characters in Unicode.
  Its focus is different from this post’s, but a lot of what he’s writing
  about was directly applicable to my line of thought too.
</p>
<p>
  In <a href="http://blog.zydeo.net/chinese-typefaces/" title="Chinese typefaces">another post</a>
  I was wondering about the confusing naming of Song or Ming typefaces,
  which are apparently the same thing in the guise of two distinct
  dynasties. A casual remark in Ishida’s article holds a piece of the
  puzzle:
</p>
<blockquote><p>“To see these correctly you need to apply the right font, e.g. a Song font for simplified and a Ming font for traditional.”</p></blockquote>
<p>
  That jibes with what I found when reviewing the Chinese fonts
  available in Windows – you can see an S for the Song typefaces and a T
  for the Ming typefaces in my table.
