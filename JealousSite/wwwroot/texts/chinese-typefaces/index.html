<p class="lede">While thinking about the best way to visually present dictionary entries in Zydeo I had to dig into Chinese typography, so I thought I’d do a couple of posts to share what I’ve learned in the process. I hope you’ll find some of this information useful.</p>

<p>
  The biggest decision was what kind of a typeface to use for showing
  Chinese characters, and I needed reference points in order to make a
  good choice. If your background is similar to mine, you’re probably more
  familiar with “Western” typography, so let’s start from there, and then
  move on to the Chinese script.
</p>
<h2>Latin/Greek/Cyrillic typography</h2>
<p>
  In “Western” typography, or more precisely, in typesetting text in
  the Latin, Greek or Cyrillic (LGC) alphabets, there are two major kinds
  of typefaces: serif and sans-serif. The difference is in the small lines
  attached to the end of strokes, as illustrated by this image:
</p>

  <figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serif</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Serif typefaces are alternatively called “Roman,” and Times New Roman is probably the most widely used one of them:</p>
<p>
  <img src="/files/zydeo-blog/ctf-02-times.png" alt="." width="660" height="61" />
</p>
<p>
  Sans-serif is alternatively called “Grotesque” or “Gothic,” and my
  favorite is Tahoma, although Arial is probably more widespread:
</p>
<p>
  <img src="/files/zydeo-blog/ctf-03-tahoma.png" alt="." width="579" height="69" />
</p>
<p>
  The difference between serif and sans-serif is more than aesthetics.
  There is pretty solid evidence that it’s less demanding on the brain to
  read lots of printed text in a serif typeface; conversely, until very
  recently, the simpler shapes of sans-serif letters were better suited
  for computer displays. As even average screens approach retina
  resolution, this is distinction is quickly becoming obsolete.
</p>
<p>
  Other factors come into play, however: depending on the typeface
  you’re seeing, you trust the exact same text slightly more or less. <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/08/hear-all-ye-people-hearken-o-earth/?_r=0" target="_blank">Errol Morris demonstrated this</a>
  convincingly in 2012 through an experiment on the readers of The New
  York Times. It’s a fascinating story, make sure you follow up on the
  link. And if you’re doing PR for a multibillion-dollar research
  facility, make sure you don’t announce the discovery of the God Particle
  in a Comic font.
</p>
<p>
  But enough of the philosophical dimension of typography; let’s look
  at a few more down-to-earth aspects of LGC typefaces. Unless you’re
  using a typewriter (monospace) typeface, each letter has a distinct
  width – an “i” is narrower than an “m”. When the computer draws words on
  screen or on paper, the typeface is not only telling it what shapes to
  use for each letter; there are also intricate instructions for spacing
  letters that end up neighbors of each other in your text. This process
  is called kerning, and even if you’re not conscious of it, it makes all
  the difference between text that looks jugged and uneven, versus text
  that looks balanced and pleasant.
</p>
<p>Beyond the use or omission of serifs, the feel of an LGC typeface is mostly determined by its vertical proportions.</p>

<h2>Chinese typefaces</h2>
<p>So if we have serif and sans-serif typefaces in LGC typography, what’s the lay of the land for typesetting Chinese text?</p>
<p>Before I can even begin to look at typefaces, there are a number of key differences that lie in the nature of the script itself:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    As far as Chinese characters are concerned, variable width makes no
    sense. Each character occupies a rectangle of the same dimensions.
  </li>
  <li>
    The same concept of baseline, x-height, and parts of characters
    extending below and above lines defined by these, also does not exist.
  </li>
  <li>
    There is no fine-tuned kerning: each single-character block is
    spaced at a fix offset from the neighboring ones, regardless of the
    specific characters that participate in the rendez-vous.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  There are apparently three major types of typefaces in modern Chinese
  typography. It’s possible to loosely associate them with LGC styles,
  and while this may be a useful thing to do if you’re coming from a
  “Western” background, I am quite wary of such parallelisms – we are,
  after all, talking about a tradition that developed independently, and
  the similarities are at best superficial.
</p>
<p>
  The first is <em>regular script</em>, or <span style="font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, sans-serif;">楷书•楷書 [kǎishū]</span>, also referred to as <span style="font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, sans-serif;">楷体•楷體 [kǎitǐ]</span>.
  This script is derived directly from a form of handwriting; so much so
  that in all Chinese textbooks I’ve come across so far, the printed
  guides for teaching beginning students how to write characters are
  printed in this style. You could loosely associate Kaiti with cursive
  (handwriting) LGC typefaces. Below is a sample for <span style="font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, sans-serif;">英语 [Yīngyǔ]</span>, meaning “the English language,” in simplified characters:
</p>
<p>
  <img src="/files/zydeo-blog/ctf-07-kaiti.png" alt="." width="244" height="148" />
</p>
<p>
  The next typeface, more distant from handwriting, is alternatively referred to as Song or Ming, or in Chinese <span style="font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, sans-serif;">宋体•宋體 [sòngtǐ]</span> or <span style="font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, sans-serif;">明体•明體 [míngtǐ]</span>. I am frankly confused by the naming, and I don’t find Wikipedia’s explanation terribly enlightening either: <em>
    The
    names Song (or Sung) and Ming correspond to the Song Dynasty when a
    distinctive printed style of regular script was developed, and the Ming
    Dynasty, during which that style developed into the Ming typeface style.
  </em>
  Be that as it may, this typeface could be said to loosely correspond to
  LGC serif, due to the triangular embellishments at the end of strokes.
  Horizontal strokes tend to be strictly horizontal, uniform width, and
  narrow; vertical strokes are thicker. The same two simplified characters
  we’ve seen before, now in a Song typeface:
</p>
<p>
  <img src="/files/zydeo-blog/ctf-08-song.png" alt="." width="239" height="149" />
</p>
<p>
  Finally, the most abstract or “minimalistic” style is <span style="font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, sans-serif;">黑体•黑體 [hēitǐ]</span>,
  referred to as “East Asian gothic” by way of association to sans-serif
  typefaces. It is characterized by no embellishments at the end of
  strokes and a strong predilection for uniform-width, strictly horizontal
  or vertical lines for most stroke types.

</p>
<h2>Windows fonts</h2>
<p>
  I created a table including the Chinese fonts installed on all
  Windows systems, plus some free fonts. I’m just including a screenshot
  without more explanation here; I’ll come back to an extended version of
  this table in later posts. The first couple of fonts are Kaiti, followed
  by Song/Ming, and finally, Heiti.

<h2>Useful links</h2>
<p>
  The pages below are great starting points to get free Chinese fonts,
  and to get an overview of the fonts pre-installed on Windows systems:

  Finally, in PDF form, two theses that both deal with the more
  intricate/technical details of creating actual Chinese fonts for use in
  computers. Even if you don’t particularly care for the geeky details,
  both papers contain a fascinating introduction about Chinese typography
  and fonts in general; I personally got a huge kick out of reading them:
