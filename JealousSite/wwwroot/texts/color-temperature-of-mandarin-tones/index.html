<h1>Color temperature of Mandarin tones</h1>
<p class="lede">Call my lights dim, but I’d actually been using Pleco for years before the meaning of all those colors in each headword started to dawn on me. They stand for tones! From that baseline it was a long way until tone colors made it into <a href="http://handedict.zydeo.net/" target="_blank">HanDeDict@Zydeo</a>, and I thought that’s a good excuse for a short post on here.</p>

<h2>The idea</h2>
<p>
  Exhibit A is a screenshot from Pleco: a random (and somewhat bizarre)
  entry that shows all four tones, and in a neat ascending order too:
</p>
<p><a class="more-link" href="https://blog.zydeo.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/shot-pleco.png"><img src="10-color-temperature-of-mandarin-tones_files/shot-pleco.png" alt="." class="alignnone size-full wp-image-178" width="640" height="496"></a></p>
<p>
  You get the point: the color of each Hanzi encodes that syllable’s
  tone. There’s no color on the Pinyin syllables, and why would there be –
  tone is already part of Pinyin through the diacritics over the vowels.
</p>
<p>
  Color me skeptical. When I read and decipher Chinese text, I either
  don’t yet know a character, which means I have to look it up anyway, and
  the Pinyin then gives me the tone as part of the character’s
  pronunciation. Alternatively, I already know that character, and that
  means I know the tone too, right?
</p>
<p>
  I started to be less sure when I noticed myself reading out text and
  repeatedly hesitating about the tone in words I’d just recently learned.
  It didn’t take long before my neatly printed text was decorated with
  tone marks over many a Hanzi. Oops… Now we’re talking, well, tone
  colors.
</p>
<h2>Information or distraction</h2>
<p>Exhibit B is a list of results from HanDeDict@Zydeo, with and without tone colors.</p>
<p><a class="more-link" href="https://blog.zydeo.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/with-without.png"><img src="10-color-temperature-of-mandarin-tones_files/with-without.png" alt="." class="alignnone size-full wp-image-180" width="1833" height="965"></a></p>
<p>
  With the online dictionary as well as with the original desktop tool,
  I’ve spent the bulk of my time thinking about ways to eliminate clutter
  and complexity; ways I can reduce the interface to a single core
  purpose: the cleanest possible presentation of the information I’m
  looking for, and nothing else.
</p>
<p>Are tone colors part of that? Do they actually provide value for me, or are they superfluous at best, or a distraction at worst?</p>
<p>
  There were two factors that made me decide to add tone colors, and
  have them on by default. The more important one is aesthetics. The way
  Zydeo presents results relies heavily on typography for structure: the
  size, typeface and weight of the text should create a rhythm that makes
  it clear what belongs together, and which part of the entry stands for
  what (headword, Pinyin, translations). After adding color into the mix,
  this visual structure just seems to work even better.
</p>
<p>The second factor was: so many others cannot be wrong. If you check the most popular apps (I’m thinking <a href="https://www.pleco.com/" target="_blank">Pleco</a> and <a href="http://hanpingchinese.com/" target="_blank">Hanping</a>), they all use tone colors. So does <a href="http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php" target="_blank">MDBG</a>, the home of CC-CEDICT.</p>
<h2>Where it gets complicated</h2>
<p>
  Yup, these dictionaries all use tone colors, but apparently they use
  different systems. That’s a very bad situation to be in: once you get
  used to one set of colors, it’s extremely confusing when you’re suddenly
  confronted with a different set. If you, like me, keep switching
  between keyboard layouts, you’ll know exactly what I mean.
</p>
<p>
  The idea of using color for tones seems to originate from Nathan Dummitt’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Through-Tone-Color/dp/0781812046/" target="_blank">Chinese through Tone and Color</a>. The specific colors he chose are apparently the subject of <a href="http://www.sinosplice.com/life/archives/2009/08/11/tone-and-color-in-chinese" target="_blank">some controversy</a>,
  and the fact is that Pleco (to my mind the gold standard of Chinese
  dictionary apps) chose a scheme that’s quite different. Albert Wolfe
  took it all apart in <a href="http://laowaichinese.net/tone-colors-and-what-pleco-did-with-them.htm" target="_blank">Tone Colors and What Pleco Did with Them</a>.
</p>
<p>For the heck of it, let’s bring in Exhibit C: Dummitt’s and Pleco’s colors on the color wheel (screenshots from <a href="https://color.adobe.com/" target="_blank">Adobe Kuler</a>).</p>
<p><a class="more-link" href="https://blog.zydeo.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dummit-pleco.png"><img src="10-color-temperature-of-mandarin-tones_files/dummit-pleco.png" alt="." class="alignnone size-full wp-image-181" width="1652" height="1622"></a></p>
<p>
  I find it fascinating that both schemes walk around the wheel
  counter-clockwise to get colors for tones 1 through 4. Both have the
  arguable weakness of relying on red vs. green, which is an accessibility
  issue for those with red/green color blindness.
</p>
<p>
  I find Dummitt’s less saturated, softer colors more appealing. They
  are a good match for the soft, green-based color scheme of
  HanDeDict@Zydeo; a conscious choice whose purpose is to keep the
  interface itself discreetly in the background, ceding the floor to
  content.
</p>
<p>
  Yet as I was test-driving the dictionary with both color schemes,
  Pleco’s saturated colors performed better, at least in my own subjective
  judgement. And even though Dummitt’s <span style="background-color: #f41c2f;">one</span> and <span style="background-color: #e76c18;">two</span> are about as far from each other as Pleco’s <span style="background-color: #151cf1;">three</span> and <span style="background-color: #8b03c0;">four</span>,
  the visual contrast seems to be a lot smaller. Ultimately, Pleco’s
  scheme won out as the default, but you can change that in Options.
