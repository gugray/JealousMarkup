<h1>PC speak Chinese</h1>
<p class="lede">I’ve explored and collected a wealth of links to online resources as I was working on Zydeo. I hope you’ll find some of these pointers useful; I get the personal benefit of keeping them organized here for my own future reference.</p>

<p>
  This post contains relatively non-geeky stuff such as fonts,
  dictionaries and translated example sentences. Make sure you check out
  its follow-up, <a href="http://blog.zydeo.net/pc-speak-chinese-2/" title="PC speak Chinese #2">PC speak Chinese #2</a>,
  where it gets more funky with character recognition, frequency lists,
  stroke order animations and creating new characters out of thin air.

<h2>Fonts</h2>
<p>
  Zydeo is all about typography, and the font I’m using to display
  results was probably the one area that received the greatest share of my
  attention. Whether or not you’re developing a dictionary yourself,
  having the right font at hand to write Chinese may be equally important
  to you. I have a few posts about fonts right here on this blog (you can
  find them under the <em>Fonts</em> tag). As for Chinese fonts on the Internets:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Free Chinese fonts from the University of Heidelberg:</b><br>
    <a href="http://www.clearchinese.com/resources/fonts.htm" target="_blank">http://www.clearchinese.com/resources/fonts.htm</a><br>
    One of these fonts serves as a fallback simplified font installed with
    Zydeo, but in general caution is advised. Most of them date from the
    1990s, and have fairly limited coverage. Additionally, the link to the
    Heidelberg University page is broken; this site seems to be the only
    place where these files are available now.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>An overview of Chinese fonts that come with Windows:</b><br>
    <a href="http://www.pinyinjoe.com/windows-7/win7-chinese-fonts.htm" target="_blank">http://www.pinyinjoe.com/windows-7/win7-chinese-fonts.htm</a><br>
    An extremely useful source; make sure you also check out the other page it links to, <a href="http://www.pinyinjoe.com/pinyin/pinyin_addins.htm" target="_blank">More Chinese Fonts &amp; Apps</a>.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>The Arphic Ming and Kai fonts:</b><br>
    <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/CJKUnifonts/Download/" target="_blank">http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/CJKUnifonts/Download/</a><br>
    Previously a commercial font, it was open-sourced by its creators and
    has apparently been a standard part of many Linux distributions since
    2006.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Noto Sans:</b><br>
    <a href="https://www.google.com/get/noto/#/" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/get/noto/#/</a><br>
    I was already working on Zydeo when Google and Adobe released this font.
    It’s part of an ambitious and much-needed drive to create a font that
    covers every single character you can possibly write down in Unicode.
    The name comes from “no tofu,” i.e., no more empty squares on screen for
    characters that your font cannot display. It is an extremely simple,
    Hei or “East Asian gothic” typeface, which makes it very readable on
    screen even at small sizes, but I think this same simplicity makes it
    less suitable for a dictionary. When I’m looking at new characters, I
    need the hints that a cursive script encodes about strokes and their
    directions, and much of this is hidden in a Hei font.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Free dictionaries</h2>
<p>
  No, I don’t mean the kinds that you can actually use to look up
  words. I mean the three open-source, community-edited projects that
  underly practically every dictionary site, tool and app that you can use
  or download for free. The mother of them all is <a href="http://www.edrdg.org/jmdict/edict.html" target="_blank">EDICT</a>,
  the Japanese-English dictionary started in 1991 by Jim Breen. This is
  the project that inspired CEDICT, which in turn inspired the
  Chinese-German and French-German counterparts.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>CC-CEDICT</b>, the dictionary on which Zydeo is built:<br>
    <a href="http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?page=cedict" target="_blank">http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?page=cedict</a><br>
    It is the direct successor to the original CEDICT (started by Paul
    Andrew Denisowski in 1997), now under a Creative Commons license. It has
    about 112k entries at the time of writing.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>HanDeDict</b>, the Chinese-German dictionary:<br>
    <a href="http://www.handedict.de/" target="_blank">http://www.handedict.de/</a><br>
    Started in 2006 based on a translation of CC-CEDICT, it currently
    contains about 145k entries. The latest downloads are from May 2011, so I
    am not completely sure how actively the project is being maintained
    right now. HanDeDict also goes beyond CC-CEDICT’s aims and adds
    part-of-speech information (noun, verb etc.), plus more details about
    subject field (biology, science etc.). But because every entry appears
    to be forever “unverified,” I sometimes have less than complete
    confidence in the data.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>CFDICT</b>, the Chinese-French dictionary:<br>
    <a href="http://www.chine-informations.com/chinois/open/CFDICT/" target="_blank">http://www.chine-informations.com/chinois/open/CFDICT/</a><br>
    Contains about 64k entries at the time of writing.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>CC-ChEDICC</b> is Chinese-Spanish, and the CC-CEDICT site still
    links to it, but its website is no longer available. It would be a pity
    if this project simply ceased to exist without the data available
    anywhere.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>
    Finally there is <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/" target="_blank">Wictionary</a>,
    which “aims to describe all words of all languages using definitions
    and descriptions in English.” I have very serious doubts that this is
    the right way to approach a Chinese dictionary (or any dictionary, in
    fact), and most of all, there doesn’t appear to be any machine-readable
    output or export.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Example sentences</h2>
<p>
  With any dictionary I find short usage examples and entire sentences
  extremely useful; often such examples are in fact sneaky ways of
  presenting collocations or grammatical information about headwords.
  CC-CEDICT’s format is extremely simple, which is a good thing because it
  allows a potentially very large group of people that are not
  lexicographers to contribute using only a text editor. Unfortunately,
  such a simple format does not allow complications like examples of use.
  So one of the things I’m looking at is to enhance Zydeo by linking in
  external sources of translated sentences. Here’s what I have found while
  looking for such sources.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Tatoeba:</b><br>
    <a href="http://tatoeba.org/eng/" target="_blank">http://tatoeba.org/eng/</a><br>
    A collection of sentences and their translations, and as the website
    says, “it’s collaborative, open, free and even addictive.” There are
    currently about 41k Chinese sentences with an English translation, and
    the data is downloadable in a machine-readable format.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Translated TED talks:</b><br>
    <a href="https://wit3.fbk.eu/mono.php?release=XML_releases&amp;tinfo=cleanedhtml_ted" target="_blank">https://wit3.fbk.eu/mono.php?release=XML_releases&amp;tinfo=cleanedhtml_ted</a><br>
    I haven’t gone very deeply into this source, but it seems quite
    promising – lots of TED talks are getting translated through
    crowdsourcing, with a license that should allow their inclusion in a
    free tool like Zydeo. And it’s all XML.<br>
