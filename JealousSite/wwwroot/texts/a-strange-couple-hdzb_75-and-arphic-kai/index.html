<p class="lede">In my search for the right regular script (Kai) display font for Chinese characters in Zydeo, I discovered two free fonts and became quite intimately familiar with both of them. Much of the story behind them is shrouded in mystery (and that’s not very likely to change), but even the little details tell a fascinating story.</p>

<h2>HDZB_75 aka DMFin aka 汉鼎简中楷</h2>
<p>
  This is the first free font I found, years ago already, on the <a href="http://www.clearchinese.com/resources/fonts.htm" target="_blank">ClearChinese.com</a>
  site. (This seems to be the page, by the way, that all searches for
  Chinese fonts eventually take you to.) The story of this font, hiding
  behind the nondescript file name “HDZB_75.TTF,” clearly goes back to the
  early, heroic days at the dawn of the digital age (read: 2005 or
  thereabouts), when getting a Windows computer to display Chinese text
  somehow, <em>anyhow</em>, was a major challenge.
</p>
<p>
  Read this thread, excited and desperate at the same time, from the Desktop Publishing Forum: <a href="http://desktoppublishingforum.com/bb/showthread.php?t=3223" target="_blank">Finally, Chinese fonts! But now I can’t use them…</a>
  The original poster appears to have just discovered this same family of
  HDZB fonts, but had to struggle nearly two weeks before the font even
  showed up for him.
</p>
<p>
  Long before I started working on Zydeo, I have been using this font
  for printing out texts and memory cards for myself. I like the Kai
  typeface because it is reminiscent of handwriting – a big plus when
  you’re learning your first few hundred Hanzi. Now I was tempted to take a
  closer look.
</p>
<p>First, this is what <a href="http://fontforge.github.io/en-US/" target="_blank">FontForge</a> says in terms of copyright information:</p>
<p>
  <img src="/files/zydeo-blog/ctypo-arphic-01-hdzb-fontforge.png" alt="." width="702" height="376" />
</p>
<p>
  That doesn’t exactly take you closer to the font’s source. A Google
  search for “Bejing Handing” yields all of 2000 results, none of which
  have much to do with fonts. “ByJOSSQ” will take you mostly to pre-2010
  discussions about Chinese fonts, including the one quoted above. They’re
  generally siren songs to the tune of “what can I do to make this work?”
</p>
<p>As fonts go these days, HDZB_75 covers very few code points: a measly 8307 in total. You can check out the exact coverage in <a href="http://blog.zydeo.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/fnt-coverage.xlsx">this Excel workbook</a>, where I reproduce the coverage of several fonts in separate sheets.</p>
<p>The font is clearly a simplified one: both in terms of the characters covered and the style of those characters.</p>
<h2>Arphic PL UKai</h2>
<p>
  Let’s leave the mysterious HDZB_75 for a moment and take a look at
  the other obvious free Kai font you are likely to come across. It seems
  to be a standard part of Ubuntu and other Linux distributions since 2006
  or so, and is available <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/CJKUnifonts/Download/" target="_blank">here</a> (plus many other places).
</p>
<p>
  That particular page is very economical when it comes to dispensing
  information about the origins of this open-source font, but it quickly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arphic_Technology" target="_blank">turns out</a>
  it is derived from a font created and released publicly by Arphic
  Technology (文鼎科技) in 2001. Some more digging will take you to this
  fascinating <a href="http://sophie.zarb.org/distrib/Fedora/14/i386/media/updates/by-pkgid/b2b573ca42dd7b6644237d876bfcadc8/files/5" target="_blank">change log</a>
  by the Linux folks working on the font between 2003 and 2008. After
  2008 – silence. I haven’t been able to find any trace of further work on
  AR PL UKai.
</p>
<p>
  When it comes to coverage, this font includes an impressive 24133
  code points – and that’s truly impressive for at least two reasons.
  First, we’re talking about 2008. It took another 6 years before another
  free font surpassed this number: it is Noto, created in a joint effort
  by Adobe and Google. Second, those 24133 code points include 5403 that
  are above 65535, or beyond the double-byte range. None of the other
  fonts that I have been able to check on Windows, with the exception of
  Noto, can say the same.
</p>
<p>
  For quite a while I was convinced the Arphic font was a traditional
  one in terms of style (it is universal in terms of coverage). I let
  myself believe this without seriously checking it because of three
  things. One was a pure assumption: Arphic is a Taiwanese company, so I
  simply thought the font would follow the traditional style. The second
  was a single glyph with a split grass radical:
</p>
<p>
  <img src="/files/zydeo-blog/ctypo-arphic-02-ying.png" alt="." width="64" height="74" />
</p>
<p>
  The third thing is that the file is a font collection, TTC, with
  separate TTFs inside for CN, TW and HK. I naïvely thought that each of
  these embedded typefaces would hold what it says on the box – but that
  turns out to have been yet another false assumption.
</p>
<h2>Arphic Kai – traditional or simplified?</h2>
<p>
  A look at a few of the characters that are rendered differently in
  traditional fonts reveals that Arphic Kai’s DNA is rather on the
  simplified side. Below are a couple of such characters, the top row
  showing them in DFKai-SB, a traditional font of Microsoft pedigree, and
  the bottom row in Arphic.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="/files/zydeo-blog/ctypo-arphic-03-simptrad.png" alt="." width="703" height="239" />
</p>
<p>
  Apart from the split grass radical in 英, which is the one character I
  infelicitously ended up focusing on, the majority of the others in the
  image exhibit features that are characteristic of simplified typefaces.
  But not all of them. I officially forgive myself for being confused.
</p>
<p>The punchline is near the top of the change log I linked to earlier:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    0.2.20080216: Compile font as TrueType Collection (TTC):<br>Contains
    4 font flavors (CN, HK, TW, TW MBE) which map to different glyph
    styles. Currently this is only a proof of concept with only 2 codepoints
    (U+4EE4 and U+9AA8) between CN, HK and TW flavors and 13 different
    glyphs between the TW and TW MBE flavors. All other glyphs are exactly
    the same in all flavors.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is from 2008. After that, the changes stop.</p>
<p>For the sake of completeness, here’s the font information about AR PL UKai TW from FontForge:</p>

</p>
<h2>Cross-pollination</h2>
<p>
  Before I lost my confidence about the Arphic font’s
  simplified/traditional nature, I was quite self-confident that I would
  just use HDZB_75 to print simplified characters, and use Arphic for
  traditional and as a fallback for code points not covered by HDZB_75. To
  achieve that, I had to manually “calibrate” the way Zydeo prints
  characters with the two fonts because the glyphs are at a very different
  vertical position within the reported display rectangle. OK, that
  sounds a bit complicated, but take a look at the image below; that
  should make it clear:
</p>
<p>
  <img src="/files/zydeo-blog/ctypo-arphic-05-vofs.png" alt="." width="190" height="106" />
</p>
<p>
  The first character is printed in HDZB_75, the second in Arphic Kai.
  If you mix the two, you need to manually offset each character to make
  them align.
</p>
<p>
  But hey… Wait a second! Don’t these two characters look really,
  really similar? Let’s take an even closer look at them, and let’s throw
  in the same character from a different simplified Kai font, KaiTi:
</p>
<p>
  <img src="/files/zydeo-blog/ctypo-arphic-06-threesome.png" alt="." width="1277" height="400" />
</p>
<p>
  I’ll be damned if the first two images are not precisely, <em>exactly</em>
  identical, apart from the slightly different vertical offset. Regular
  script characters might look similar from the distance, but if you look
  at the third one, there are countless subtle differences in the length
  and shape of each stroke, the bumps at their end, the overhang where two
  orthogonal strokes meet and the like. But not between the two shapes on
  the left.
</p>
<p>
  Admittedly, there are glyphs that are eerily similar (or identical)
  between HDZB_75 and Arphic Kai, and there are others with clear
  differences. But the level of overlap is striking even upon casual
  observation.
</p>
<p>
  The original Arphic copyright is 1994 through 1999; the copyright of
  the derived public font is 2003 through 2007. The Beijing Handing
  copyright is 1994 through 1997. Somewhere in between these dates and
  eerily similar shapes is a story that will probably forever remain
  unclear. Both fonts have been out there for free for over ten years now;
  it’s probably best to keep that mystery as it is.
