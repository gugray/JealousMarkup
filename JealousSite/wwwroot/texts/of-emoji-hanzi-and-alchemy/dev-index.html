<h1>Of emoji, Hanzi and alchemy</h1>
<p class="lede">I hate emoji. You know, those colorful icons: smiley faces, sad faces, thumbs up and their countless friends that we use all the time in short text messages and email. It’s not that I’m a purist that thinks emoji spell the end of literacy, particularly among those horrible teenagers. No, quite the contrary: I know full well that language and culture have been in constant decline since at least the time of the ancient Greek; I don’t buy into this kind of stuff. I actually like icons in text.</p>

<p>
  It’s about typography. I hate emoji because in almost every single
  messaging app and word processor, they aggressively replace my
  painstakingly typed ASCII emoticons and ruin the aesthetics of the
  message. I created a couple of examples; for starters, here’s WhatsApp’s
  emoji crime, taken straight from the Windows Phone app. Check out that
  uneven line spacing because of the smiley face:

<p>
  You could say, and you might be justified, that this is only my
  exaggerated sensitivity and I should seek counsel elsewhere, but read
  on.

<h2>Chinese/English hybrid text</h2>
<p>
  Any Chinese-English dictionary will have a mix of English text and
  Chinese Hanzi in the “body” of entries, i.e., in the part that provides
  translations, paraphrases and other meta-information about each
  headword. There’s a post dedicated entirely to the presentation of
  CEDICT’s seemingly flat, structure-less entries, but let’s take a quick
  glance at a fairly typical example here:
</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.zydeo.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ctypo-emo-02-entry.png"><img src="04-of-emoji-hanzi-and-alchemy_files/ctypo-emo-02-entry.png" alt="." class="alignnone size-full wp-image-95" width="849" height="206"></a></p>
<p>
  That might seem easy enough, but in reality just about all the odds
  are against you if you want to make this entry look good. For starters,
  Latin text is aligned to the baseline, a horizontal line you could draw
  under a line of text that would just touch the bottom of each character.
  Chinese characters are built differently; they don’t have a baseline.
  There is a lot of typographical detail about Latin and Chinese typefaces
  in <a href="http://blog.zydeo.net/chinese-typefaces/" title="Chinese typefaces">this post</a> if you care to know.
</p>
<p>
  What happens if you simply use the built-in text rendering routines
  and pass them a string of mostly Latin letters, with a few Hanzi thrown
  in there? This is what happens – you can try it yourself, the screenshot
  is from Microsoft Word:
</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.zydeo.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ctypo-emo-03-badline.png"><img src="04-of-emoji-hanzi-and-alchemy_files/ctypo-emo-03-badline.png" alt="." class="alignnone size-full wp-image-97" width="593" height="197"></a></p>
<p>
  Does that look familiar? Yup. It’s the emoji effect. The Latin font
  in the text is 11pt Calibri; the Chinese font is 11pt Noto Sans Thin.
  The Hanzi are not really aligned to anything in particular; they’re sort
  of glued to the Latin font’s baseline, but not precisely. If you switch
  to a different font – say, MingLiU, the Hanzi slide down a bit below
  the baseline, and the extra line height is reduced, but not completely
  eliminated. Remember, this is still 11pt MingLiU; I’m keeping the font
  size constant for now.
</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.zydeo.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ctypo-emo-04-goodline.png"><img src="04-of-emoji-hanzi-and-alchemy_files/ctypo-emo-04-goodline.png" alt="." class="alignnone size-full wp-image-98" width="605" height="187"></a></p>
<p>
  In reality, you need a somewhat larger typeface for Chinese text. An
  11pt sans-serif typeface is perfectly fine on screen, but in my
  experience, you need about 1.3 times the size for readability with
  Hanzi. (In fact, the Chinese and Japanese editions of Windows XP were
  shipped with a higher base font size, which effectively meant a higher
  DPI setting – everything from text to window headers to icons was
  somewhat larger than on a typical 96 DPI English system. This was
  something we specifically had to deal with in the software I’m designing
  in my day job, but curiously, I cannot find any relevant links via
  Google now.)
</p>
<p>But back to hybrid text in Zydeo. With a larger font size for Hanzi, the naïve and easy way of drawing text would give you this:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.zydeo.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ctypo-emo-03-badline.png"><img src="04-of-emoji-hanzi-and-alchemy_files/ctypo-emo-03-badline.png" alt="." class="alignnone size-full wp-image-97" width="593" height="197"></a></p>
<h2>Reconciliation and magic constants</h2>
<p>
  Let’s take an inventory of the issues you need to solve to render
  hybrid Chinese/English text so that both the Latin runs and the Hanzi
  are readable and the whole still looks balanced and pleasant:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Whatever Latin font you’re using, you need to calculate its baseline so you can align Hanzi relative to that.</li>
  <li>
    Your Hanzi font’s point size should be somewhat larger (in my
    subjective judgment, 1.3 times larger) than the Latin font’s point size.
  </li>
  <li>
    You need to figure out the dimensions of the real display rectangle
    of each Hanzi, as opposed to the dimensions reported by the system
    routines.
  </li>
  <li>
    Again, in my subjective judgment, you need to position the Hanzi so
    that they extend below the Latin letters’ baseline; or more precisely, I
    found that aligning the vertical center of Hanzi at about 2/3 the
    x-height of that Latin typeface works well.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ideally, you want to abstract away all this font-specific
    information so that you can easily choose a different font with
    different idiosyncratic properties and not mess up the entire rendering
    of entries.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  There are several “magic constants” in this. I can’t explain
  scientifically why I feel 1.3 times the point size is right for Hanzi,
  nor why I think it’s most pleasant to align them against the Latin text
  just the way I described it. But this is a recurring experience, whether
  I’m dealing with the finer points of visual design or natural language
  processing: at the end of the day, the mix typically includes a handful
  of magic constants that you cannot explain “scientifically” – you just
  keep experimenting until you are satisfied with the results. If I’m
  pressed to be honest, then often what us designers and computer geeks
  are doing is as much alchemy as science.
</p>
<p>
  Particularly, finding out about the characteristics of each Chinese
  typeface I considered was a matter of trial-and-error, and I constantly
  had the feeling I was working against whatever system routines I had to
  rely on, not with them. But that, too, is a familiar feeling to anyone
  who’s been creating software for Windows.
</p>
<h2>One good word for Skype</h2>
<p>
  I can’t refrain from returning to emoji at the end of this post. I
  wrote earlier how practically all messaging apps out there frustrate me
  with their disregard for typographic balance when they throw in icons in
  the middle of running text. Skype was no exception, until the very last
  update this January. Then, much to my surprise, I discovered they did
  something unexpected and dealt exactly with this peeve of mine. The
  screenshot below speaks volumes.
