<p class="lede">Who needs another Chinese dictionary, and a desktop tool at that? Or: Zydeo 1.0’s release notes.</p>

<p>
  Zydeo started as a hobby project in the summer of 2014. For several
  months I didn’t truly believe it would grow beyond a harmless outlet for
  my urge to fiddle with things, experiment with user interfaces, and
  code just for the fun of it. But soon enough this creature took on a
  life of its own, and I realized it was becoming precisely the dictionary
  I wanted to use in my own (often abortive) effort to learn Mandarin.
</p>
<p>
  A big part of the inspiration came from Bret Victor’s 2006 article,
  <a href="http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/" target="_blank">Magic Ink</a>,
  which resonated with my own thinking about user interfaces. A
  dictionary is pure information software, where the best kind of
  interaction is no interaction at all. I suddenly understood why I found
  many of the existing online and desktop dictionaries so cumbersome. When
  I’m deciphering a Chinese text, I’m in a flow where I don’t want the
  dictionary to be the center of my attention; I want it to get out of the
  way. I don’t want to put in asterisks to fine-tune my search, and I
  don’t want to go through a monotonous, cluttered list to find what I’m
  looking for. I hope to give as little input as possible, and have the
  computer figure out the right answer for me.
</p>
<p>
  Gradually, a coherent picture of the dream tool emerged. Because
  we’re dealing with an ideographic script, character recognition is a
  must. Until I know what a character <em>is</em>, I cannot type it on a
  computer, and looking up unknown characters is exactly what I’m doing
  when I’m trying to understand an unfamiliar text.
</p>
<p>
  Once I draw or type my query, I want the software to figure out my
  question. If it’s Hanzi, it should recognize that and search for Hanzi.
  If it’s Pinyin, it should search in the Pinyin headwords. In all other
  cases, it must be English, so it should search in English equivalents or
  glosses.
</p>
<p>
  It should not need asterisks or the like to know if I’m looking for a
  full word or a part of something. It should simply rank the most likely
  entries higher in the output. And it should lay out the results in a
  format where I can easily find the bits of information I’m looking for –
  in other words, it should rely on typography so I can skim the results
  quickly, and use highlights to show which part of each entry answers my
  question.
</p>
<p>
  The moment of thrill came when I found that every single building
  block I needed was already out there, open-source, free to use. Jordan
  Kiang created a character recognition tool,
  <a href="http://www.kiang.org/jordan/software/hanzilookup/" target="_blank">HanziLookup</a>,
  in 2006. It is in Java, and my platform on Windows is different, but I
  could port it with reasonable effort. And there is of course
  <a href="http://cc-cedict.org/wiki/" target="_blank">CC-CEDICT</a>,
  an open-source, community-edited dictionary with over 110 thousand entries.
</p>
<p>
  All I had to do was to bring these building blocks together and
  combine them in a sleek user interface. Getting there involved a lot of
  plain old schlep, but more importantly, it was a process of sawing off
  unnecessary details and reducing the tool to the essentials: eliminating
  any clutter and interaction that was not absolutely necessary. You can
  find the details of this journey documented in the blog, written up in
  posts that range from abstract design ideas to very specific tricks of
  the Windows developer’s trade.
</p>
<p>
  I put about three person-months’ work into the first version of Zydeo
  (over a much longer period, of course), but because my job would have
  been completely and utterly impossible without all the open-source
  resources out there, I chose to open-source my own work too. In this way
  I hope Zydeo will be a useful tool for those who are interested in
  Chinese, while the source code, the data I produced as a side effect,
  and the blog posts may be a useful resource for developers.
</p>
<p><em>Enjoy.</em></p>
