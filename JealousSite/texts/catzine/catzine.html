<h1>CAT Zine</h1>

<p>
  CAT stands for computer-aided translation: that is, software that professional translators use to
  translate better and faster, and to enjoy the process more.
  But if you're here, you probably know that already. I think CAT tools
  are awesome, and my index finger agrees. So much so, in fact, that it went looking for a touchscreen and started drawing
  these graphics. I'm not quite sure what to call them: Comics? A fanzine? I went with CAT Zine.
</p>
<p>
  I hope you'll enjoy looking at them. I'm certainly having tremendous fun drawing them, and while that lasts, they'll
  keep on coming.

  Full disclosure: I work for Kilgray, creators of the world's most awesomest CAT tool,
  <a href="https://memoq.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">memoQ</a>. But everything you find in these drawings
  applies to all advanced CAT tools. My index finger is technology-agnostic.
