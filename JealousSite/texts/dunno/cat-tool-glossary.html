    <h2><a name="0010">activation</a></h2>
    <p>
      A short communication between an installed program and the manufacturer’s website. The program sends your serial number and
      a few anonymous details about your computer. The website checks that you own a license or that you are just starting a
      free trial, and returns a code to authorize the program to run on your computer.

    <h2><a name="0020">alignment</a></h2>
    <p>
      Often, when you get a document to translate, you receive a set of previously translated documents along with it, or you can
      find matching pages on websites. Those may contain a whole lot of translations you could use either as
      <a href="#1300">TM matches</a> or through <a href="#0200">concordancing</a>. Problem is, the <a href="#1290">TM</a> needs
      segments, and you have whole documents. Alignment means splitting source and target documents into segments, and
      algorithmically finding out which target segment corresponds to which source segment. Not a straightforward thing
      to do! Advanced <a href="#0150">CAT</a> tools have a function to automate the bulk of the work and help you correct the rest.

  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0030">analysis</a></h2>
    <p>
      Before you accept a job, you need to know how much text there is to translate. But you already have <a href="#1290">TMs</a>
      with past translations, so you also want to know how much new text there is, and how many fuzzy or exact
      <a href="#1300">matches</a> you can expect. That’s what analysis does: it compares your text against your TMs and
      <a href="#0530">corpora</a>, and gives you a neat breakdown expressed in segment, word and character counts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Analysis is sometimes used interchangeably with statistics, which has absolutely no fancy scientific meaning in this context.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0040">API; application programming interface</a></h2>
    <p>
      A fancy term to say that a program allows other programs to use its functions, just as if a human was clicking its
      buttons. If a program has no API, then it’s impossible to integrate it with other systems, and humans end up with
      tendonitis from lots of completely unnecessary clicking. It is particularly important to make sure a cloud-based
      tool you’re considering has an API. If it does not, you may get locked in, with no easy way to retrieve your data
      if you want to switch.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0050">auto save on server</a></h2>
    <p>
      When you’re working in a memoQ online project, your translations are initially saved only on your computer.
      You can choose to synchronize[1170] a few times a day, but if you enable auto save, your translations are
      sent to the server immediately, without holding you up. This way others can see your work *almost* as if you were
      editing a Google doc in real time. What better way to stay consistent?
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0060">automatic concordance</a></h2>
    <p>
      If you want to see how an expression has been translated, concordance[0200] gives you exactly that.
      But a good CAT[0150] tool can do more: by looking at the source segment it can find the parts that occur in a
      lot of other segments, and point you to them. That’s effectively saying, “Hey! These phrases seem to be all
      over the place, it’s probably a good idea to concordance them right now!” And if you’re <i>very</i> lucky, those
      phrases also occur as entire source segments, and the TM[1290] or corpus[0530] will give you their translation
      right away.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0070">AutoPick</a></h2>
    <p>
      I don’t know about you, but I hate to type numbers as I’m translating, and I also hate to lose the flow to
      select, copy and paste something over from the source. In addition to numbers, source segments also contain
      other things that can go straight into your translation: tags[1220], non-translatables[0790], terms[1260].
      If you just press and release Ctrl (in memoQ), AutoPick highlights all the special entities in your source,
      lets you cycle through them with the arrow keys, and insert the next one with a single keystroke. It also
      re-formats numbers to match your target language’s conventions.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0080">auto-propagation</a></h2>
    <p>
      Almost every text you translate has repetitions[1050]: segments that occur multiple times. With some technical
      texts these may even make up the majority. One responsibility of TMs[1290] is to pick these up, but CAT tools
      can do even better. If you enable auto-propagation, then as soon as you confirm a segment, the tool immediately
      populates all the other occurrences in the document and marks them as confirmed[1100].
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0090">auto-translatables</a></h2>
    <p>
      Most texts (particularly technical, legal and financial) have recurring entities that follow some pattern.
      Think of a date: 05/27/1978, to be “translated” as 27.5.1978. Auto-translation rules allow you to create
      regular expressions[1030] that recognize and transform such patterns in an incredibly flexible way.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0100">BiDi</a></h2>
    <p>
      Short for bidirectional text, i.e., the right-to-left scripts used to write languages like Arabic, Hebrew or Farsi.
      It’s bidirectional because numbers and some proper names in Latin letters are written from the left within the overall
      right-to-left text flow.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0110">bilingual Excel</a></h2>
    <p class="cref">See <a href="#0740">multilingual Excel</a></p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0120">bilingual RTF</a></h2>
    <p>
      A specially formatted Word document that contains a translation’s source and target segments[1090], and often
      also comments[0190] and other information. This way, a translator can share work in progress with a client or a
      domain expert who has no CAT[0150] tool, only a word processor. CAT[0150] tools, in turn, can read an edited
      bilingual RTF with edits and comments, and bring the changes back into the translation environment. Some old
      formats relied on hidden text and were very easy to ruin with a single misplaced edit. These days it’s more common to
      see a table with three or more columns.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0140">CAL license</a></h2>
    <p>
      CAL is short for “concurrent access license.” While individual licenses allow a single person to use a program,
      an organization can purchase CAL licenses instead, which can be handed out to any end user on an on-demand basis.
      The limitation is how many people can use the tool at the same time; it doesn’t matter who they are or
      where they work from.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0150">CAT; Computer Aided Translation</a></h2>
    <p>
      Software that helps translators and reviewers work more efficiently and in good quality, even if the work involves
      many people working simultanously on the same large text. Sometimes the name is reduced to “TM[1290] tool” because
      TMs were the first function that CAT tools focused on. Jost Zetzsche prefers <i>translation environment tools</i>, or TEnT;
      I tend to agree. Translation Management System (TMS)[1320] is often used synonymously because the border, really,
      is quite blurry.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0160">CCJK</a></h2>
    <p>
      Stands for the three East Asian languages, Chinese, Japanese and Korean. There are two Cs because Chinese can be
      written either with simplified characters (PRC and Singapore) or traditional ones (Hong Kong and Taiwan).
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0170">check out</a></h2>
    <p>
      When a translator or reviewer checks out an online project in memoQ, the tool downloads the assigned documents
      and sets up a correctly configured working environment. This eliminates saving email attachments and going
      through an error-prone series of steps, saving time and ensuring all project participants work with the right
      resources and settings.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0180">CMS; content management system</a></h2>
    <p>
      Software used to edit, organize and publish large amounts of content. A CMS typically tracks who is responsible
      for what content, whether it is approved or obsolete, what the content applies to, and much more. Often, CMSes
      break down content into smaller chunks, which are reused in several related documents. CMSes are important
      because an incredible amount of text that gets translated comes from them, typically as small chunks of XML[1410]
      and often in the DITA[0227] format.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0190">comment</a></h2>
    <p>
      In a CAT[0150] tool you can mark entire documents, source or target segments[1090], or just a short part
      within a segment. You can add a remark, or use the function to simply highlight something. This way you can
      communicate with other translators, reviewers or even clients, or just bookmark something for yourself to
      return to later. You can keep comments private, or choose to export them as part of the finished translation.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0200">concordance</a></h2>
    <p>
      A function of translation memories[1290] and LiveDocs corpora[0530] that allows you to search for a word or
      expression, retrieving all translated segments where it occurs. This is nothing short of a small wonder,
      allowing you to “Google” existing translations. memoQ also highlights the expression’s most probable translation
      within the target segments, just like Linguee, but from your own private data.

    <h2><a name="0220">context ID</a></h2>
    <p>
      Usually a short machine-readable text that identifies a string[1162] that belongs to a specific place in an
      app or a game. It’s crucial to distinguish between, say, “Open” on a label (translated into German as “Offen”)
      or on a button (translated as “Öffnen”). The TM[1290] stores the ID and returns a context match[1300] if the
      same text occurs with the same ID later.

    <h2><a name="0240">CSV; comma-separated values</a></h2>
    <p>
      A seemingly simple text-based format that stores several values in each line, separated by commas. It’s
      still widely used to exchange glossaries[1260], and sometimes even for translatable content. In spite of
      its apparent simplicity it’s very easy to mess up; the most common problem is using the wrong code page
      instead of Unicode[1355].

    <h2><a name="0270">deliver</a></h2>
    <p>
      The translator or reviewer’s action to signal that they are finished with their task, such as the translation
      of a given document. Delivery is not a symbolic step: in a system like memoQ, it usually triggers a series
      of actions like automated QA[1000] checks or emailing the finished translation back to the end client.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0275">dictation</a></h2>
    <p>
      Technology that allows you dictate text, instead of typing it on a keyboard. Commercial tools have become
      incredibly good for major languages. Dictation is preferred by a minority of translators; they, however,
      report a productivity boost of 50% or more over typists.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0276">dicto</a></h2>
    <p>
      A neologism derived from <i>typo</i>. It means an error by the dictation software. Unlike typos, which are nonsensical
      on an elementary level, dictos are insidious because they are valid phrases that sound like what was intended,
      but mean something completely different, like an immature middle school joke. Think Uranus.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0277">DITA</a></h2>
    <p>
      Short for Document Information Typing Architecture, DITA is exactly as unsexy as it sounds, but tremendously
      useful. It is an open standard that defines how to structure and reuse content in CMS[0180] systems. The
      format is based on XML[1410], and if your CAT[0150] tool supports it, you can deal with a huge share of the
      content coming from several different CMSes.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0280">DTP; desktop publishing</a></h2>
    <p>
      DTP tools include the likes of FrameMaker and InDesign, used to produce professionally typeset printed
      documents. In the industry DTP typically means an activity after translation and review. Translated text
      looks really bad in the original format unless you adjust the typesetting to accommodate longer paragraphs,
      different special characters, or even a complete left/right directional swap.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0290">edit distance</a></h2>
    <p>
      A number that expresses how different one text is from another, usually derived from the number of insertions,
      deletions and swaps needed to get from one to the other. While similar TM matches are qualified by fuzzy[1300]
      match rates, edit distance is sometimes used to measure the extent of a reviewer’s changes.

    <h2><a name="0330">file format filter</a></h2>
    <p>
      One key benefit of CAT[0150] tools is that you always translate in the same familiar editor, regardless of the
      file format your text came in. That means CAT tools must somehow extract the text from all the different file
      formats. The component that does this is called a file format filter: it “filters” text from all the other
      stuff in the file. Bringing the text into the CAT tool is called <i>importing</i> a file; retrieving the translation
      in the original format is called <i>exporting</i> it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every filter comes with its own options that affect how it works (“Do you want to extract the hidden text
      from this Word file?”), and for some formats, notably XML[1410], these settings make an enormous difference.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0340">find/replace listing</a></h2>
    <p>
      In memoQ, the Find function has an option that puts all occurrences on a separate list, instead of walking
      through them one by one from the pop-up window. The outcome is the find/replace listing, where you can
      review each segment[1090] comfortably and decide where to replace and where to leave as is.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0350">font substitution</a></h2>
    <p>
      Many file formats, particularly from DTP[0280] tools, tend to use fonts that look really good, but cannot draw
      a lot of special characters. If your target language happens to have a lot of these, the translated file will
      look ugly, or skip letters outright. Font substitution is a function of file format filters[0330] that tweaks
      the file, replacing the original font with one that has the right glyphs for your target language.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0360">fragment assembly</a></h2>
    <p>
      If there is no exact or fuzzy match for a segment in your TMs[1290] or corpora[0530], a lot of the segment’s
      parts may still have a match from a term base[1260], non-translatables[0790] or auto-translatables[0090].
      Fragment assembly takes all of these and just replaces them with their target equivalents, giving you a
      patchwork segment that might still take a lot less work to brush up than translating it from scratch.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0370">fuzzy</a></h2>
    <p>
      First impressions are correct here: this is one of the fuzziest words in the entire industry jargon.
      Initially a <i>fuzzy match</i> was used in contrast to an exact match from a TM[1290]: you get a translation
      that is fully legit, except it’s the translation of something more or less different from your current
      source segment[1090]. Just how different is expressed by the fuzzy match rate. Eventually fuzzy matching
      was also extended to terminology[1260], where it can be pretty useful if your language is in the habit of
      changing letters in the middle of words.

      existing TMs[1290] and corpora[0530]. But even if you start with an empty TM, as you progress in a document,
      you will start getting matches from your own new translations! The homogeneity function quantifies these “internal”

    <h2><a name="0420">horizontal layout</a></h2>

      A two-column grid layout where  you see source on the left and target on the right has engulfed CAT[0150] tools
      like a flash flood washing away a hapless creekside camper’s stock of ABC soup. But many a translator still
      prefers to see their target text below the source. The horizontal layout option reshuffles the active segment’s
      dominos, so source and target show up one below the other.

      To “leverage” past translations is fancy talk for: the tool gives me what I already translated, I don’t need
      to do it again. “Leverage” as a noun is fancy talk for the extent that happens: if a tool promises to enhance
      leverage, you should expect to type fewer new characters while translating the same text.
