      <p>
        I wrote this glossary mostly for my own delight (yes, I know, my hobbies are known to be on the
        bizarre side), but also to help folks who are trying to cut their way through the translation
        industry jargon. For a crowd whose mission is to help people communicate, we sure have come
        up with a pretty dense web of insider vocab, huh?
      </p>
      <p>
        I encourage you to take everything here with a generous pinch of salt. It is just one guy’s
        take one things, and the guy in question has a dog in this fight through his affiliation with
        <a href="https://memoq.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">memoQ</a>.
        Which is, objectively, the world’s most awesomest CAT tool. Right. But seriously, I did my best to
        stay tool-agnostic here. I included the least possible amount of memoQ jargon, but I consciously
        did not include jargon from any other tools. I simply feel I have neither the knowledge nor the
        authority to do that, and anyways, thataway be dragons.

    <h2><a name="0010">activation</a></h2>
    <p>
      A short communication between an installed program and the manufacturer’s website. The program sends your serial number and
      a few anonymous details about your computer. The website checks that you own a license or that you are just starting a
      free trial, and returns a code to authorize the program to run on your computer.

  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0020">alignment</a></h2>
    <p>
      Often, when you get a document to translate, you receive a set of previously translated documents along with it, or you can
      find matching pages on websites. Those may contain a whole lot of translations you could use either as
      <a href="#1300">TM matches</a> or through <a href="#0200">concordancing</a>. Problem is, the <a href="#1290">TM</a> needs
      segments, and you have whole documents. Alignment means splitting source and target documents into segments, and
      algorithmically finding out which target segment corresponds to which source segment. Not a straightforward thing
      to do! Advanced <a href="#0150">CAT</a> tools have a function to automate the bulk of the work and help you correct the rest.
    </p>

  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0030">analysis</a></h2>
    <p>
      Before you accept a job, you need to know how much text there is to translate. But you already have <a href="#1290">TMs</a>
      with past translations, so you also want to know how much new text there is, and how many fuzzy or exact
      <a href="#1300">matches</a> you can expect. That’s what analysis does: it compares your text against your TMs and
      <a href="#0530">corpora</a>, and gives you a neat breakdown expressed in segment, word and character counts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Analysis is sometimes used interchangeably with statistics, which has absolutely no fancy scientific meaning in this context.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0040">API; application programming interface</a></h2>
    <p>
      A nerdy term to say that a program allows other programs to use its functions, just as if a human was clicking its
      buttons. If a program has no API, then it’s impossible to integrate it with other systems, and humans end up with
      tendonitis from lots of completely unnecessary clicking. It is particularly important to make sure a cloud-based
      tool you’re considering has an API. If it does not, you may get locked in, with no easy way to retrieve your data
      if you want to switch.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0050">auto save on server</a></h2>
    <p>
      When you’re working in a memoQ <a href="#0810">online project</a>, your translations are initially saved only on your computer.
      You can choose to <a href="#1170">synchronize</a> a few times a day, but if you enable auto save, your translations are
      sent to the server immediately, without holding you up. This way others can see your work *almost* as if you were
      editing a Google doc in real time. What better way to stay consistent?
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0060">automatic concordance</a></h2>
    <p>
      If you want to see how an expression has been translated, <a href="#0200">concordance</a> gives you exactly that.
      But a good <a href="#0150">CAT</a> tool can do more: by looking at the source segment it can find the parts that occur in a
      lot of other segments, and point you to them. That’s effectively saying, “Hey! These phrases seem to be all
      over the place, it’s probably a good idea to concordance them right now!” And if you’re <i>very</i> lucky, those
      phrases also occur as entire source segments, and the <a href="#1290">TM</a> or <a href="#0530">corpus</a> will give you their translation
      right away.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0070">AutoPick</a></h2>
    <p>
      I don’t know about you, but I hate to type numbers as I’m translating, and I also hate to lose the flow to
      select, copy and paste something over from the source. In addition to numbers, source segments also contain
      other things that can go straight into your translation: <a href="#1220">tags</a>, <a href="#0790">non-translatables</a>, <a href="#1260">terms</a>.
      If you just press and release Ctrl (in memoQ), AutoPick highlights all the special entities in your source,
      lets you cycle through them with the arrow keys, and insert the next one with a single keystroke. It also
      re-formats numbers to match your target language’s conventions.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0080">auto-propagation</a></h2>
    <p>
      Almost every text you translate has <a href="#1050">repetitions</a>: segments that occur multiple times. With some technical
      texts these may even make up the majority. One responsibility of <a href="#1290">TMs</a> is to pick these up, but CAT tools
      can do even better. If you enable auto-propagation, then as soon as you confirm a segment, the tool immediately
      populates all the other occurrences in the document and marks them as <a href="#1100">confirmed</a>.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0090">auto-translatables</a></h2>
    <p>
      Most texts (particularly technical, legal and financial) have recurring entities that follow some pattern.
      Think of a date: 05/27/1978, to be “translated” as 27.5.1978. Auto-translation rules allow you to create
      <a href="#  ">regular expressions</a> that recognize and transform such patterns in an incredibly flexible way.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0100">BiDi</a></h2>
    <p>
      Short for bidirectional text, i.e., the right-to-left scripts used to write languages like Arabic, Hebrew or Farsi.
      It’s bidirectional because numbers and some proper names in Latin letters are written from the left within the overall
      right-to-left text flow.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0110">bilingual Excel</a></h2>
    <p class="cref">See <a href="#0740">multilingual Excel</a></p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0120">bilingual RTF</a></h2>
    <p>
      A specially formatted Word document that contains a translation’s source and target <a href="#1090">segments</a>, and often
      also <a href="#0190">comments</a> and other information. This way, a translator can share work in progress with a client or a
      domain expert who has no <a href="#0150">CAT</a> tool, only a word processor. CAT tools, in turn, can read an edited
      bilingual RTF with changes and comments, and bring the updates back into the translation environment. Some old
      formats relied on hidden text and were very easy to ruin with a single misplaced edit. These days it’s more common to
      see a table with three or more columns.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0140">CAL license</a></h2>
    <p>
      CAL is short for “concurrent access license.” While individual licenses allow a single person to use a program,
      an organization can purchase CAL licenses instead, which can be handed out to any end user on an on-demand basis.
      The limitation is how many people can use the tool at the same time; it doesn’t matter who they are or
      where they work from.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0150">CAT; Computer Aided Translation</a></h2>
    <p>
      Software that helps translators and reviewers work more efficiently and in good quality, even if the work involves
      many people working simultaneously on the same large text. Sometimes the name is reduced to “<a href="#1290">TM</a> tool” because
      TMs were the first function that CAT tools focused on. Jost Zetzsche prefers <i>translation environment tools</i>, or TEnT;
      I tend to agree. <a href="#1320">Translation Management System (TMS)</a> is often used synonymously because the border, really,
      is quite blurry.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0160">CCJK</a></h2>
    <p>
      Stands for the three East Asian languages, Chinese, Japanese and Korean. There are two Cs because Chinese can be
      written either with simplified characters (PRC and Singapore) or traditional ones (Hong Kong and Taiwan).
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0170">check out</a></h2>
    <p>
      When a translator or reviewer checks out an <a href="#0810">online project</a> in memoQ, the tool downloads the assigned documents
      and sets up a correctly configured working environment. This eliminates saving email attachments and going
      through an error-prone series of steps, saving time and ensuring all project participants work with the right
      resources and settings.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0180">CMS; content management system</a></h2>
    <p>
      Software used to edit, organize and publish large amounts of content. A CMS typically tracks who is responsible
      for what content, whether it is approved or obsolete, what the content applies to, and much more. Often, CMSes
      break down content into smaller chunks, which are reused in several related documents. CMSes are important
      because an incredible amount of text that gets translated comes from them, typically as small chunks of <a href="#1410">XML</a>
      and often in the <a href="#0227">DITA</a> format.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0190">comment</a></h2>
    <p>
      In a <a href="#0150">CAT</a> tool you can mark entire documents, source or target <a href="#1090">segments</a>, or just a short part
      within a segment. You can add a remark, or use the function to simply highlight something. This way you can
      communicate with other translators, reviewers or even clients, or just bookmark something for yourself to
      return to later. You can keep comments private, or choose to <a href="#0330">export</a> them as part of the finished translation.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0200">concordance</a></h2>
    <p>
      A function of <a href="#1290">translation memories</a> and LiveDocs <a href="#0530">corpora</a> that allows you to search for a word or
      expression, retrieving all translated segments where it occurs. This is nothing short of a small wonder,
      allowing you to “Google” existing translations. memoQ also highlights the expression’s most probable translation
      within the target segments, just like Linguee, but from your own private data.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0210">confirmed</a></h2>

  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0220">context ID</a></h2>
    <p>
      Usually a short machine-readable text that identifies a <a href="#1162">string</a> that belongs to a specific place in an
      app or a game. It’s crucial to distinguish between, say, “Open” on a label (translated into German as “Offen”)
      or on a button (translated as “Öffnen”). The <a href="#1290">TM</a> stores the ID and returns a <a href="#1300">context match</a> if the
      same text occurs with the same ID later.
    </p>

  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0240">CSV; comma-separated values</a></h2>
    <p>
      A seemingly simple text-based format that stores several values in each line, separated by commas. It’s
      still widely used to exchange <a href="#1260">glossaries</a>, and sometimes even for translatable content. In spite of
      its apparent simplicity it’s very easy to mess up; the most common problem is using the wrong code page
      instead of <a href="#1355">Unicode</a>.
    </p>

  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0270">deliver</a></h2>
    <p>
      The translator or reviewer’s action to signal that they are finished with their task, such as the translation
      of a given document. Delivery is not a symbolic step: in a system like memoQ, it usually triggers a series
      of actions like automated <a href="#1000">QA</a> checks or emailing the finished translation back to the end client.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0275">dictation</a></h2>
    <p>
      Technology that allows you dictate text, instead of typing it on a keyboard. Commercial tools have become
      incredibly good for major languages. Dictation is preferred by a minority of translators; they, however,
      report a productivity boost of 50% or more over typists.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0276">dicto</a></h2>
    <p>
      A neologism derived from <i>typo</i>. It means an error by the dictation software. Unlike typos, which are nonsensical
      on an elementary level, dictos are insidious because they are valid phrases that sound like what was intended,
      but mean something completely different, like an immature middle school joke. Think Uranus.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0277">DITA</a></h2>
    <p>
      Short for Document Information Typing Architecture, DITA is exactly as unsexy as it sounds, but tremendously
      useful. It is an open standard that defines how to structure and reuse content in <a href="#0180">CMS</a> systems. The
      format is based on <a href="#1410">XML</a>, and if your <a href="#0150">CAT</a> tool supports it, you can deal with a huge share of the
      content coming from several different CMSes.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0280">DTP; desktop publishing</a></h2>
    <p>
      DTP tools include the likes of FrameMaker and InDesign, used to produce professionally typeset printed
      documents. In the industry DTP typically means an activity after translation and review. Translated text
      looks really bad in the original format unless you adjust the typesetting to accommodate longer paragraphs,
      different special characters, or even a complete left/right directional swap.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0290">edit distance</a></h2>
    <p>
      A number that expresses how different one text is from another, usually derived from the number of insertions,
      deletions and swaps needed to get from here to there. While similar TM matches are qualified by <a href="#1300">fuzzy</a>
      match rates, edit distance is sometimes used to measure the extent of a reviewer’s changes.

    <h2><a name="0330">file format filter</a></h2>
    <p>
      One key benefit of <a href="#0150">CAT</a> tools is that you always translate in the same familiar editor, regardless of the
      file format your text came in. That means CAT tools must somehow extract the text from all the different file
      formats. The component that does this is called a file format filter: it “filters” text from all the other
      stuff in the file. Bringing the text into the CAT tool is called <i>importing</i> a file; retrieving the translation
      in the original format is called <i>exporting</i> it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every filter comes with its own options that affect how it works (“Do you want to extract the hidden text
      from this Word file?”), and for some formats, notably <a href="#1410">XML</a>, these settings make an enormous difference.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0340">find/replace listing</a></h2>
    <p>
      In memoQ, the Find function has an option that puts all occurrences on a separate list, instead of walking
      through them one by one from the pop-up window. The outcome is the find/replace listing, where you can
      review each <a href="#1090">segment</a> comfortably and decide where to replace and where to leave as is.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0350">font substitution</a></h2>
    <p>
      Many file formats, particularly from <a href="#0280">DTP</a> tools, tend to use fonts that look really good, but cannot draw
      a lot of special characters. If your target language happens to have a lot of these, the translated file will
      look ugly, or skip letters outright. Font substitution is a function of <a href="#0330">file format filters</a> that tweaks
      the file, replacing the original font with one that has the right glyphs for your target language.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0360">fragment assembly</a></h2>
    <p>
      If there is no exact or fuzzy match for a segment in your <a href="#1290">TMs</a> or <a href="#0530">corpora</a>, a lot of the segment’s
      parts may still have a match from a <a href="#1260">term base</a>, <a href="#0790">non-translatables</a> or <a href="#0090">auto-translatables</a>.
      Fragment assembly takes all of these and just replaces them with their target equivalents, giving you a
      patchwork segment that might still take a lot less work to brush up than translating it from scratch.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="0370">fuzzy</a></h2>
    <p>
      First impressions are correct here: this is one of the fuzziest words in the entire industry jargon.
      Initially a <i>fuzzy match</i> was used in contrast to an exact match from a <a href="#1290">TM</a>: you get a translation
      that is fully legit, except it’s the translation of something more or less different from your current
      source <a href="#1090">segment</a>. Just how different is expressed by the fuzzy match rate. Eventually fuzzy matching
      was also extended to <a href="#1260">terminology</a>, where it can be pretty useful if your language is in the habit of
      changing letters in the middle of words.

    <h2><a name="0380">global find & replace</a></h2>
    <p>
      In the olden days, the find function only worked if you first opened a document. Global find & replace
      searches through all documents in your project: a massive difference if, for instance, your job entails
      hundreds of tiny <a href="#1410">XML</a> files from a <a href="#0180">CMS</a>.

      One thing that no <a href="#0150">CAT</a> tool copes with well is mixed languages in a source document.
      In memoQ there is a well-hidden feature in the mundane function to <a href="#0560">lock</a> segments. This inconspicuous option will algorithmically detect each segment’s language, and if it’s different from your document’s source language, lock it.

      Independently

    <h2><a name="0600">MT; machine translation</a></h2>
    <p>
      A computer system that transforms a sequence of characters into a different sequence of characters that is
      recognizable, to a human, as text in another language, with relevant clues about the information in the
      original text. MT systems come in three main flavors. In rules-based (RBMT) systems, humans hand-craft
      grammatical rules. In statistical (SMT), a statistical system is trained on large amounts of
      human-translated text. Neural (NMT) systems are also trained on human-translated data, but they
      need a lot more computation, and have been reported to produce superior results.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tools like Google MT are generic. In the translation industry it is more common to train specialized
      systems that do really well on a single type of content. This needs MT experts and a body of relevant,
      high-quality human translations for the training data.
    </p>
    <p>
      One way in which MT is used is human post-editing: the MT system produces a rough translation that
      is often incorrect and ungrammatical, but is cheaper/faster to fix by humans than to translate from
      scratch. Another way is interactive MT, where the human translator receives suggestions from the
      MT system while she is translating text in a <a href="#1050">CAT</a> tool.

Project templates define rules for all of these and a lot more, so you don’t make embarrassing mistakes, don’t get tendonitis from incessant clicking, and have a fighting chance to stay sane in the midst of it all. Also, project templates allow you to reuse the work of experts like <a href="#0542">localization engineers</a> and make it a lot simpler for new hires to get up to speed.

      Translation is the fun part, but if you’re dealing with complex file formats from esoteric systems, you need to make sure your work will also make it back to the original system at the end and not crash your client’s multimillion-dollar flagship app right before the deadline.

    <h2><a name="1090">segment</a></h2>
    <p>
      When we translate text, we almost always proceed sentence by sentence. If you try to get to the bottom of it,
      however, nobody really knows what a sentence precisely is. Also, when you translate a single word in a
      bullet-point list, is that a sentence? <a href="#0150">CAT</a> tools decided to sidestep this can of worms altogether,
      so we speak about <i>segments</i> instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally (though not always), a segment is the essential unit of translation: you proceed segment by segment in the editor, and you store the translation of segments in the <a href="#1290">TM</a>. Your TM and <a href="#0530">corpus</a> matches also refer to the segment you are translating at the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Segments are born with the active cooperation of <a href="#1030">regular expressions</a>, in a special incarnation called
      <i>segmentation rules</i>. As all regex, they look gibberish to the uninitiated eye, but they basically elaborate
      a single theme: “If you find sentence-final punctuation like a period followed by one or more spaces followed
      by a capital letter, start a new segment right there. Except if the last word before the period is a known
      abbreviation.” Segmentation normally happens quietly, behind the scenes, when your CAT tool’s
      <a href="#0330">file format filter</a> imports a source document.
    </p>
    <p>
      No matter how elaborate, segmentation rules will inevitably get it wrong from time to time. To help get around this, CAT tools have a function to join neighboring segments, and to split a single segment into two.

In this form, there’s a whole lot to know about segments beside the text itself: does the target come from a <a href="#1290">TM</a>, or from you? Have you confirmed it already? Was it rejected by a reviewer? Is it halfway edited but not quite finished yet? That is the kind of information that you can see in the form of colors and icons within the translation environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      For several years after they arrived, my friends from Mars were convinced translators were in the business of turning empty (grey) segments into confirmed (green) ones, and they thought this was a terribly appealing job. By now they know they were wrong, but they still think the job is awesome.

To avoid such an outcome, the <a href="#1000">QA</a> module of <a href="#0150">CAT</a> tools gives you a tag error right in the editor, and won’t let you <a href="#0270">deliver</a> your translation until you fix it.

      <a href="#1220">Tags</a> can be a real nuisance as you translate: you need to think about where they must go, you need special shortcuts to insert them, and generally, they throw you out of the flow.

This most often happens with Word documents that an <a href="#0800">OCR</a> tool produced from a <a href="#0840">PDF</a> because it wanted to make sure everything is shown exactly in the right place, down to a hundredth of a millimeter. You can make things better by tweaking the OCR tool’s settings, running a cleanup macro like Dave Turner’s CodeZapper, or pestering your CAT tool’s developers to do something about it. Only the first two have been conclusively shown to work.

  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="1220">tags</a></h2>
    <p>
      The content we need to translate consists mostly of text – but not exclusively. One oddity is formatting changes: how do you represent a change of text color in the middle of a sentence? The other oddity is a consequence of structured content, where text is intertwined with markup like hyperlinks, cross-references, or placeholders that will be substituted with, say, a number when a piece of software runs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="#0150">CAT</a> tools cope with all this by introducing tags: symbols inside your <a href="#1090">segments</a> that act like a
      character in the editor, but look completely different. These creatures are called
      <i>inline</i> or <i>internal</i> tags.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then you have formats like <a href="#1410">XML</a> or HTML that have tags woven into their own DNA. Some of these tags
      define structure (“this is a headword”, “this is a caption”), always enclosing text from the outside.
      These are called <i>structural</i> or <i>external</i> tags, and should never show up in your segments. They only do
      if the XML <a href="#0330">filter</a> was not configured properly before the import. You can fix that by hiring a good <a href="#0542">localization engineer</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="#0030">analysis</a> output of well-behaved CAT tools has a separate section that shows how many tags the text contains in addition to good old-fashioned characters. This is important, because tags can be a lot of work and really slow you down as you translate.

As in: “I have just turned this User Guide into 1300 segments and pre-translated them. Now give me those segments that have no TM <a href="#1300">match</a>, occur at least <a href="#1050">twice</a>, and have the words ‘squinting squirrels’ in them. Also, show me each segment only once, and order them alphabetically.” That is the kind of thing that views allow you to do.

    <h2><a name="1375">web editor</a></h2>
    <p>
      A component of <a href="#0150">CAT</a> tools that allows translators and reviewers in an <a href="#0810">online project</a> to work from a browser, without installing software on their own computer. A web editor is to traditional desktop tools as Google Docs is to Word, except advanced CAT tools offer both options (even within the same project) and don’t force you to choose between two incompatible companies.

    <h2><a name="1390">working, master and reference TM</a></h2>
    <p>
      Keeping stuff organized is an age-old challenge. If you don’t get it right, you end up with <a href="#1345">trash in, trash out</a>. One way to stay on top of data within a translation project is to designate one <a href="#1290">TM</a> as the master (translations coming from there get precedence over others); another one as the working TM (new, as-yet unrevised translations get stored there, keeping the master pristine); and the rest as reference (to fill in the gaps that the master does not cover).

    <h2><a name="1400">XLIFF</a></h2>
    <p>
      Short for XML Localization Interchange File Format, a standard maintained by OASIS. In practice, it is a file format that allows translatable text to be passed between tools in a source/target, bilingual form.

  <div class="entry">
    <h2><a name="1410">XML; eXtensible Markup Language</a></h2>
    <p>
      An extremely versatile format for storing structured information in files that are readable by machines
      and not <i>completely</i> unreadable by humans. A tremendous amount of content that gets translated comes from
      XML files, particularly if the content’s source is a <a href="#0180">CMS</a> system. You generally don’t need to understand
      the dirty details unless you are a <a href="#0542">localization engineer</a>, in which case you are a wizard who knows
      all about <a href="#0330">file format filters</a> and don’t need this glossary anyway.

    <h2><a name="1420">X-translate</a></h2>
    <p>
      So you’re half done translating a file, with tons of <a href="#0190">comments</a> in there and segments in all imaginable <a href="#1100">statuses</a>. At this point your client calls you and says, “Hey, our editors have been busy, we have a revised source file, we actually need you translate that instead of the one from last week.” If your <a href="#0150">CAT</a> tool has X-translate, this is not a problem. The function compares the original source document with the updated source document, going <a href="#1090">segment</a> by segment, and recreates your work, including comments, ignored <a href="#1000">QA</a> warnings, segment statuses and all the rest. Whatever changed in the source text is left empty, so you can catch up with the changes and continue where you left off.
