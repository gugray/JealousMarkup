</p>

<p>
  With .NET Core 1.0 fresh off the press, the Windows developer in me that has a decade-long experience with C# is thrilled by the new cross-platform opportunities. In this series of articles I'm putting on the hat of a full-stack web developer and lay the groundwork for a tiny open-source web application. Along the way I'll show you how to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>get started with a Debian Virtual Private Server (VPS) and run your first .NET program;</li>
  <li>get the Linux environment ready for the real world;</li>
  <li>build your first .NET Core web app;</li>
  <li>configure a free domain name;</li>
  <li>set up NGINX for use as a reverse proxy;</li>
  <li>code and build in Visual Studio 2015 and publish on Linux;</li>
  <li>enable HTTPS with a free certificate from Let's Encrypt</li>
  <li>architect a simple single-page app with jQuery and AJAX</li>
  <li>add a database to the mix</li>
</ul>
<p>There is enough stuff here for several articles, so let's get started!</p>

<h1>Get your VPS</h1>
<p>
  Virtual Private Servers are the coolest kid on the block. With a bit of research you can find several providers that allow you to get your own Linux server up and running in a matter of minutes and operate it for as little as five bucks a month. I find this thrilling because of the freedom it gives you over the usual hosting plans with very narrow options to configure a site under IIS. The coolness of .NET Core 1.0 is that it allows you to use your C# and Windows skillset and run your web app in a cheap, instant Linux VPS.
</p>
<p>So go get your very own VPS.</p>
<p>
  Are you done? Then your provider will have given you an IP address and an initial root password. Let's put them to good use. Throughout this series I'll be using Debian 8.5; your mileage may vary slightly depending on your particular flavor of 'nux.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    <b>CAUTION: At the time of writing, .NET Core binaries are only available for x64 Linux distros.</b>
    Do yourself a favor and make sure you get a 64-bit system, even though for anything with less than 4 gigs of RAM, 32-bit makes a lot more sense - and we're after a tiny VPS here. More on this in the last section of this article.
  </p>

<h1>E.T. on the phone: PuTTY and WinSCP</h1>
<p>If you're using these two tools every day, skip right through to the next section. Otherwise, read on.</p>
<p>
  Download and install PuTTY and WinSCP from here:<br />
  <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html" rel="noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html</a><br />

</p>
<p>
  <b>PuTTY</b> gives you a terminal console into the Linux system over a secure SSL connection. It's a mind-bogglingly simple tool, but here are two useful tweaks.
</p>
<p>
  1: Save a session. All this means in practice is that you enter your server's IP address (or domain name once you've obtained one), give it a name, and hit the <i>Save</i> button. That adds it to the list so you can simply double-click later to connect.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  2: Make the console bigger. By default, every time you connect, PuTTY will give you an 80x24 character screen,
  which is way too small for any practical purpose. Load an existing session; go to <i>Window</i> on the left; put in
  your favorite size (for me the sweet spot is at 100x38); head back to <i>Session</i> and save. Happy connecting ever after.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="/files/other/putty-set-size-sm.png" alt="." width="450" height="443" />
</p>
<p>
  <b>WinSCP</b> is what self-respecting people really mean when they say FTP. It allows you to upload and download files over a secure connection, without broadcasting passwords and data in plain, unencrypted form - to the great delight of all the script kids lurking around. WinSCP has the same, familiar two-column layout as Norton Commander or its later sibling, FAR Manager.
  (And FAR Manager <i>is</i> the first tool you always install after Windows, right?)
</p>
<h1>First login</h1>
<p>
  Fire up PuTTY and connect. Your Linux system will initially only have a "root" account. With my provider, I chose to get an initial root password instead of setting up an SSH key, so the first time I log in I must change that password right away:
</p>
<p class="code"><b>login as: root</b>
<b>root@46.101.122.226's password:</b>
You are required to change your password immediately (root enforced)

</p>

<p>
  This may or may not be the same in your case, but this system throws a threat right at me about the system's invalid locale, so let's get that out of the way real quick. That goes hand in hand with the default character set, where UTF-8 is a no-brainer, so the incantations look like this:
</p>
<p class="code"><b>root@debian-512mb-fra1-02:~# locale</b>
locale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory
locale: Cannot set LC_MESSAGES to default locale: No such file or directory

<b>root@debian-512mb-fra1-02:~# locale-gen en_US.UTF8</b>

en_US.UTF-8... done
Generation complete.
<b>root@debian-512mb-fra1-02:~# localectl set-locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8</b>
</p>
<p>
  (I highlighted the incantations in bold so they stand out from all the French that Linux throws back at you. I'll do this in every subsequent shell sample.)
</p>
<p>
  Your top priority right now is to stop being <i>root</i>. It's terribly easy to mess up a single character in a Linux
  incantation and end up with one that has tragic consequences; and <i>root</i> has the powers to do it all. One slip of
  the keyboard and the dementors will do Horrible Things to your system. Below I'll create a user called <i>gabor</i> that's
  an ordinary citizen except he can <i>pretend</i> to be root for a single incantation at a time, by prepending the magic
  word <i>sudo</i>. Do this, leave stage with <i>exit</i>, and log right back in as your less dangerous self. Here's how it goes.
</p>
<p class="code"><b>root@debian-512mb-fra1-02:~# adduser gabor</b>

<b>root@debian-512mb-fra1-02:~# visudo</b>
</p>

<p>The trick here is the very last command, <i>visudo</i>. That opens a magic file with the default editor:</p>
<p>
  <img src="/files/other/visudo.png" alt="." width="624" height="340" />
</p>
<p>So you can append a line under the one for "root" like so:</p>
<p class="code"># User privilege specification
root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
<b>gabor   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL</b></p>
<p>Save your edit and exit the console with <i>exit</i>. Log back in as yourself.</p>

<h1>Get .NET!</h1>
<p>
  Back as yourself? Good. Time for magic: we shall now install .NET on this Linux box.<br />
  Official instructions:
  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#debian" rel="noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#debian</a>
</p>
<p class="code"><b>gabor@debian-512mb-fra1-02:~$ sudo apt-get install curl libunwind8 gettext</b>
Reading package lists... Done
<i>#
# Omitted many-many lines of output
#</i>
<b>gabor@debian-512mb-fra1-02:~$ curl -sSL -o dotnet.tar.gz https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=809130</b>
<b>gabor@debian-512mb-fra1-02:~$ sudo mkdir -p /opt/dotnet && sudo tar zxf dotnet.tar.gz -C /opt/dotnet</b>
<b>gabor@debian-512mb-fra1-02:~$ sudo ln -s /opt/dotnet/dotnet /usr/local/bin</b>
</p>
<p>Now let's unwrap things here a bit.</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>apt-get install</i> is the Linux equivalent of "download these packages and install them."</li>
  <li>The <i>curl</i> command downloads a file from the Microsoft link and saves it in the current folder, which is your user's home folder right after login.</li>
  <li>
    The next <i>sudo</i>'d command creates a directory under <span class="code">/opt</span> and unpacks the downloaded file right into it.
    <span class="code">/opt</span> is one of the standard places on Linux to install custom applications.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="code">ln -s</span> creates a symlink to the <i>dotnet</i> executable in <span class="code">/usr/local/bin</span>,
    which is the directory for system-wide commands. In other words, anyone can now say <i>dotnet</i> and the system will dotnet for them.
  </li>
  <li>The syntax for the symlink command is <span class="code">ln -s actualfile symlink</span>. This will come in handy later.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  You might as well delete the downloaded file from your home folder now. 
  <span class="code">del</span> will not work. The command is <span class="code">rm</span>.
</p>

<h1>Say hello to the world</h1>
<p>You say you got .NET on Linux? I still don't believe it. I want to see a Hello, world! program run. Let's create a subdirectory for this and tell .NET to create a new project - which will be, precisely, a Hello, world.</p>
<p class="code"><b>gabor@debian-512mb-fra1-02:~$ mkdir work</b>
<b>gabor@debian-512mb-fra1-02:~$ mkdir hwapp</b>
<b>gabor@debian-512mb-fra1-02:~$ cd hwapp/</b>
<b>gabor@debian-512mb-fra1-02:~/hwapp$ dotnet new</b>
-bash: /usr/local/bin/dotnet: cannot execute binary file: Exec format error
</p>
<p>
  Almost good. If you followed my advice from the beginning and made sure you got yourself a 64-bit system, 
  you are now seeing <i>Hello, world!</i> at the end. If, like me, you naïvely thought a 512MB instance is perfectly fine with 32 bits, 
  you're seeing the above. In that case, destroy your VPS and start again from scratch.
</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>
  So what did we achieve here? We haven't actually <i>built</i> anything yet, just murmured a bunch of magic words at the command line. And did the impossible: compiled and built a C# program, natively, on Linux.
</p>

  Check back for the 
  <a href="/texts/asp-net-core-linux-vps-2">next article</a>
  in my series, where we'll point a domain name at our freshly minted VPS, harden the system to the minimum required extent expected for a machine out in the wild, and get a real website powered by ASP.NET Core greeting unspecified sailors.
